Use the {spotapp} to copy data from applications like Salesforce, ServiceNow, Jira and others into a cloud data warehouse to make it easier for you to use the SpotApps designed for those applications.

[#prerequisites]
== Prerequisites
Before you can use the {spotapp}, you must have the following:

* These credentials for your Fivetran system:
** API Key
** API Secret
+
NOTE: You must generate these in Fivetran.

* An existing connection in Fivetran to the cloud data warehouse where Fivetran will write the data from your source application.
* Credentials for your source application from which Fivetran will copy the data (Examples: Salesforce, ServiceNow, Jira, etc).


== Creating a Fivetran job to copy your data

To create a job to copy data from your source application into your cloud data warehouse, do the following:

. Go to the SpotApp you want to use.
. Select the *Connector Blocks* tab.
. For Fivetran, click *Configure*.

. In the Authorize screen, click *Authorize*.

A page from Fivetran indicates ThoughtSpot is using Fivetran to connect to your source application.
. Click *Continue*.
+
The next page in Fivetran indicates the information you need to provide to connect Fivetran to your source application.
. Enter all the credentials for your source application, and click *Save & Test*.
+
A message appears indicating the connector is being configured, and then the SpotApps page appears again with the _Connector Blocks_ tab selected. This time, a _Reconfigure_ link appears next to the Fivetran connector block indicating the ELT job has been created in Fivetran.
+

+
After the Fivetran ELT job is complete, you are ready to deploy the SpotApp for your source application.
+
TIP: If you decide to make changes to your ELT job, you must do it in Fivetran.

. To deploy the SpotApp for your source application, refer to xref:spotapps-deploy.adoc[Deploying SpotApps].
