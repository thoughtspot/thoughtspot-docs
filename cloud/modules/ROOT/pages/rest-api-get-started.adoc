:description: To start embedding data using REST APIs, enable CORS and content security settings for your application domain.

To start embedding data using REST APIs, enable CORS and content security settings for your application domain.

Before you start using REST APIs, perform the following checks:

* Your client application domain is added as a https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/?pageid=security-settings[Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) host,window=_blank] in the ThoughtSpot Developer portal.
+
After you add your host domain for CORS, ThoughtSpot adds the `access-control-allow-origin` header in its API responses.

* You have valid login credentials and access privileges to run the operations.
* If trusted authentication is enabled on your instance, you must obtain an authentication token and include it in your subsequent login requests.

== Swagger UI

To access REST APIs on Swagger:

. Sign in to your ThoughtSpot instance.
. Access the Swagger portal.
+
To access Swagger UI, change your URL, as shown in the following example:

 https://<your-thoughtspot.com>/external/swagger
+
Go to Swagger Portal The portal displays a list of REST API services available for the logged-in ThoughtSpot users.

. Select a header to expand and view the list of services.
. Select a service name to view more details about the API service.
. To explore an API, select *Try it out*.

== API requests and response

To call a REST API, send a request to the endpoint URL with the attributes required to create, view, or modify an object.

=== Request method

Specify the HTTP request method for the Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) operation in your request to the API endpoint.
For example, GET, POST, PUT, or DELETE.

=== Query string

A query string consists of additional parameters that are passed in the URL.
For example, the `/tspublic/v1/metadata/listobjectheaders` API endpoint requires query parameters that are passed as a query string in the URL.

=== Request headers

* Make sure you include the `'X-Requested-By': 'ThoughtSpot'` header in all API requests.
* Set the `Content-Type` and `Accept` header to `application/json` for JSON and `text/plain` for plain text.
* Some complex POST operations, such as sharing an object with another user, require the URL-encoded objects to be passed as parameters in the URL.
For such API requests, use the `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` header.

=== Multipart/Form-data

Some APIs use `multipart/form-data` for POST requests and require you to provide an input file as a payload.
To know if an API uses `multipart/form-data` content-type, see the https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/?pageid=rest-api-reference[corresponding API description page,window=_blank].

=== Response body

For each API request, ThoughtSpot sends a response.
The API response includes either an HTTP status code or a response body in the JSON or plain text format.

For more information about the REST API request URL, parameters, headers, and sample response, see https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/?pageid=rest-api-reference[REST API reference,window=_blank].
