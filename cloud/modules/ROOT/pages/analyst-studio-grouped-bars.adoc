== One measure

This example will walk you through how to create a simple grouped bar chart with one continuous field that’s broken into groups based on some dimension.

1. Add a dimension to *Columns*. This discrete field will be plotted along the x-axis of your visualization, with groups formed based on the unique values within this dimension.

2. Add a continuous field to *Rows*. It will be plotted along the y-axis of your visualization, where the heights of your bars are determined by the values of that field within each x-axis group.

3. Add your second dimension to *Columns*. You’re now creating nested groups, where each pane corresponds to a value in the first dimension. In the example below, you’ll see that each `region_name` contains its own corresponding `web_event_channel` values.

4. If it isn’t already, make sure to set your Mark Type to `Bar` because you want your data to be plotted as bars.

5. Optionally, you can add the second dimension to your *Color* channel to help color-code each bar value.

== Multiple measures

This example will walk you through how to create a simple grouped bar chart when you have multiple continuous fields.


1. Add a dimension to *Columns*. This discrete field will be plotted along the x-axis of your visualization, with groups based on the unique values within this dimension.

2. Add the system-generated Measure Values to *Rows*. After you do this, you’ll see that the *Measure Values* shelf appears.

3. Add continuous fields to the *Measure Values* shelf to plot them on your visualization. These fields will be plotted along the y-axis of your visualization, where the heights of your bars are determined by the values of your fields within each x-axis group. You can think of the Measure Values field as a placeholder or variable that references the list of measures you add to the *Measure Values* shelf.

4. If it isn’t already, make sure to set your Mark Type to `Bar` because you want your data to be plotted as bars.

5. Add Measure Names to *Columns*. Doing so is extremely important as it will ensure that each field in your Measure Values shelf is represented as separate bar marks in each column; without this specification, Visual Explorer will plot each measure on top of the other.

6. Lastly, as an optional step, you can add Measure Names to the *Color* channel so each measure is color-coded. You should also now have a legend that maps each color to the corresponding field names.
