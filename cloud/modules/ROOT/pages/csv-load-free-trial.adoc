:description: The simplest way to load data is to upload a CSV or Excel file from the ThoughtSpot Web interface.

NOTE: This feature is exclusive to ThoughtSpot Free Trial.
Use Connections to access your data in ThoughtSpot Cloud.

In ThoughtSpot's free trial, you can upload your own data to perform live queries on it. You can xref:connections.adoc[connect to your cloud data warehouse], and you can upload 1 flat data file, or CSV.

Your data should be in a CSV (comma separated values) file before you load it.
A CSV file is a text file made up of data fields separated by a delimiter and optionally enclosed with an enclosing character.

Learn how to upload a CSV file. You can also edit that file later, or replace it with a different file. Note that you can only use 1 CSV file at a time.
