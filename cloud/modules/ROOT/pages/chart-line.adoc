Like the column chart, the line chart is one of ThoughtSpot's simplest, yet most versatile chart type.
More often than not the line chart will be chosen as your default chart type.

Line charts displays your data as a series of data points connected by straight line segments.
The measurement points are ordered by the x-axis value.

Your search needs at least one attribute and one measure to be represented as a line chart.
If your search has multiple attributes, you can xref:chart-column-configure.adoc#slice-with-color[slice with color] to sort by the second attribute.
