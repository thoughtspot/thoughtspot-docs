Line charts are good at showing trends over intervals of time.  Like the xref:chart-column.adoc[column chart], the line chart is one of ThoughtSpot's simplest, yet most versatile charts.
ThoughtSpot often chooses the line chart as your default visual representation.

Line charts display your data as a series of data points connected by straight line segments.
The system orders the measurement points by the x-axis value.

Your search must have at least one attribute and one measure to be represented as a line chart. If your search has multiple attributes, you can xref:chart-column-configure.adoc#slice-with-color[slice with color] to sort by the second attribute.
