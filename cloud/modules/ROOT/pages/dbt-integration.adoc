ThoughtSpot's dbt integration allows you to easily provide your existing dbt models and automatically create ThoughtSpot xref:worksheets.adoc[worksheets], which you can use to xref:search-data.adoc[search your data].

dbt takes your raw data in your data warehouse and transforms and validates it. ThoughtSpot's dbt integration  connects users to their cloud data warehouse, integrates with your dbt models using an API key or zip file, and generates the relationships between the tables defined in the dbt model that you select. It also brings any logical tables into ThoughtSpot. Then, ThoughtSpot creates new worksheets, based on the relationships between the tables. These worksheets provide user-friendly logical views of your complex datasets. Users can use these worksheets to easily search their complex data. This process may replace existing dbt tables you imported into ThoughtSpot, but it will not replace existing worksheets.

NOTE: Integration with dbt is certified only for Snowflake connections.

== Prerequisites
Before you can integrate with dbt, you must satisfy the following prerequisites

* Create a xref:connections.adoc[connection] to your external cloud data warehouse in Snowflake. This cloud data warehouse must contain the tables that are created from your dbt models.
* If you connect to dbt via *dbt cloud*, you need the API key, Account ID, and Project ID:
+
API key:: This is also called the *API token* in dbt. Any dbt user with a dbt developer license has an API token. Find your token in your dbt profile, under *API access*.
Account ID:: Your default dbt Cloud account ID. Find your account ID in your dbt Cloud URL, after you log in. For example, if your URL is `https://cloud.getdbt.com/#/accounts/12345/projects/56789/dashboard`, your account ID is `12345`.
Project ID:: Find your project ID in your dbt Cloud URL, after you log in. For example, if your URL is `https://cloud.getdbt.com/#/accounts/12345/projects/56789/dashboard`, your project ID is `56789`.
* Define the relationships in the dbt models. If you do not define the relationships, ThoughtSpot does not create tables or worksheets.
* If you are using *dbt cloud*, execute the project with the *GENERATE DOCS?* option *ON*.
* If you are using *dbt core*, execute the `dbt docs generate` command along with the `dbt run` command.
* If you are using *dbt core*, you must connect to dbt using a zip file, which must contain the latest `manifest.json` and `catalog.json` files. By default, dbt stores these files under the `<project name>/target` folder.


== Integrating with dbt
You can set up your dbt integration from the Data workspace. To integrate with dbt, follow these steps:

. Ensure that you have already xref:connections.adoc[created a connection] to your external cloud data warehouse. This cloud data warehouse must contain the tables that are created from your dbt models.

. Select *Data* in the top navigation bar.

. Select *Utilities* in the side navigation bar.

. Under *dbt Integration*, select *Open dbt integration wizard*. The dbt integration wizard opens.

. Under *Data warehouse*, select the cloud data warehouse you would like to use from the dropdown, or search for it using the search bar in the dropdown.

. Under *Database*, select the database within the cloud data warehouse that you would like to use from the dropdown, or search for it using the search bar in the dropdown. This database must contain the tables that are created from your dbt models.

. Under *Connect to dbt project*, select either *Via dbt cloud* or *Use a .zip file*. If you are using *dbt core*, you must select *Use a .zip file*.

. If you select *Via dbt cloud*, fill in the following parameters:
+
API key:: This is also called the *API token* in dbt. Any dbt user with a dbt developer license has an API token. Find your token in your dbt profile, under *API access*, and enter it in the dbt integration wizard under *API key*.
Account ID:: Your default dbt Cloud account ID. Find your account ID in your dbt Cloud URL, after you log in. For example, if your URL is `https://cloud.getdbt.com/#/accounts/12345/projects/56789/dashboard`, your account ID is `12345`.
Project ID:: Find your project ID in your dbt Cloud URL, after you log in. For example, if your URL is `https://cloud.getdbt.com/#/accounts/12345/projects/56789/dashboard`, your project ID is `56789`.

. If you select *Use a .zip file*, click the *Upload* button, and add the zip file from your files. The zip file must contain the latest `manifest.json` and `catalog.json` files. By default, dbt stores these files under the `<project name>/target` folder.

. Select *Next*.

. On the next screen, select a dbt folder to import. ThoughtSpot lists the model names, paths, and the number of tables they have. Your model must have at least 2 tables.
+

. Select *Next*.

. On the next screen, select tables to import. By default, ThoughtSpot imports all tables in the folder. Deselect any tables you do not want to import. You must select at least 2 tables within the dbt folder. These tables must have relationships to each other.
+

. Select *Finish*.

. The *Worksheets generated* page appears. ThoughtSpot generates several worksheets from your dbt models.
+

+
To inspect the worksheet details, click on any of the worksheet names. You can view the joins created between the related tables in the worksheet from the *Joins* tab for the worksheet.
+
To xref:search-data.adoc[search the data] on the worksheet, select *Search on this worksheet* next to any worksheet.

. Select *Exit*.

. On the Data workspace home page, you can see the tables and worksheets that you just created from dbt.
+

+
NOTE: This process may replace existing dbt tables you imported into ThoughtSpot, but it will not replace existing worksheets.

. If you click on any of the tables and worksheets you created, and then select *Joins*, you can see the joins ThoughtSpot created, based on the relationships in dbt.

. If there are any changes to the dbt models that you would like the ThoughtSpot worksheets and tables to reflect, you must run the dbt integration again, which creates a new set of worksheets.

== Limitations

* Currently, you can only connect to one dbt folder at a time.

* The integration does not currently support relationships defined across folders.

* You must select at least 2 tables within the dbt folder. These tables must have relationships to each other.
