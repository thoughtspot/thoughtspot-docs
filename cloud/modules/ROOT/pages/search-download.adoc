If you are using the xref:answer-experience-new.adoc[new Answer experience], your administrator set a standard footer for all Answer and Liveboard downloads. If you have admin privileges, you can edit that footer for the whole cluster from the xref:search-spotiq-settings.adoc#visualization-footer[Admin Console]. If you do not have admin privileges, you cannot edit the standard footer for downloads.

To download your search, click the *More* icon image:icon-more-10px.png[more options menu icon], and select any of the following options, depending on your search type:

* For a table, select *Download* and choose *XLSX*, *CSV*, or *PDF*. Note that this does not include pivot tables. ThoughtSpot classifies pivot tables as charts.
