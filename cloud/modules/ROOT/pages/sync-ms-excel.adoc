== Sync to Excel from an Answer

To create a sync to Excel from an Answer, follow these steps:

. Select the desired Answer from the *Answers* tab or the ThoughtSpot homepage. You must have *Can manage sync* permissions and *view* access to an Answer to create a sync.

. In the upper-right corner of the Answer, select the *more options* menu icon image:icon-more-10px.png[more options menu icon]. From the dropdown menu, select *Sync to Excel*.
+
//NOTE: You cannot create a sync from an unsaved Answer. If the *Sync to Google Sheets* option appears grayed-out in the menu, first save the Answer before trying again.

. If this is the first sync you have created for Excel, a pop-up authorization window appears. To give ThoughtSpot permission to send data to your Microsoft Excel account, enter your sign-in credentials. Microsoft will ask for a one-time password from your authenticator app.
+
NOTE: Granting Microsoft permission allows ThoughtSpot to edit or create files in Microsoft, but does not permit file deletion.


. Within ThoughtSpot, fill in the following parameters:
* Edit the *Pipeline name* if needed. By default, this field populates with _PL-[Answer Name]_.
* If you have more than one Microsoft destination set up, then the *Destination* field appears, and you must select a Microsoft destination from the dropdown menu available. However, if no destinations have been set up before or if you have only one Microsoft destination, the *Destination* field does not appear.
* Select *File name* from the dropdown menu.
* Select *Sheet name* from the dropdown menu.
* Enter the *Cell* number in A1 format.



. By default, *Sync on save* is selected. Select *Save* to send your data to Excel. Your data immediately appears in the Sheet you specified.

. [Optional] To set up a repeated sync, click *Schedule your sync* and select your timezone. From the options provided, choose whether the sync will occur every:

* _n_ minutes. You can choose to schedule a sync every 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, or 45 minutes.
* _n_ hours.
* _n_ days at a selected time. Note that you can choose not to send an update on weekends.
* week at a selected time and day.
* _n_ months at a selected time and date.

NOTE: Any sync over 50,000 rows may result in an execution timeout. For optimal performance, keep your sync to below 50,000 rows. If you're syncing a large number of rows and the sync fails, try applying filters like date filters to make your dataset smaller and then sync.


== Sync to Excel from a Custom SQL View

To sync to Excel from a custom SQL view, follow these steps:

. Navigate to your SQL view by selecting the *Data* tab and searching from the Data Workspace home page. Select the SQL view name.

. If this is the first sync you have created for Excel, a pop-up authorization window appears. To give ThoughtSpot permission to send data to your Microsoft Excel account, enter your sign-in credentials. Microsoft will ask for a one-time password from your authenticator app.

. Fill in the following parameters:
* Edit the *Pipeline name* if needed. By default, this field populates with _PL-[Answer Name]_.
* If you have more than one Microsoft destination set up, then the *Destination* field appears, and you must select a Microsoft destination from the dropdown menu available.

* *Delete* to permanently delete the pipeline.
* *Sync now* to sync your Answer or view to the designated destination.
