== Overview

At ThoughtSpot, we recognize that data is one of the most critical and valuable assets for any organization. As such, we prioritize managing our customersâ€™ data security and privacy. To achieve this, we provide robust security features that manage network, application, and data security.

== Network Security
All communication between users and ThoughtSpot Cloud is encrypted using SSL for secure transmission of data. ThoughtSpot Cloud supports TLS 1.2 and higher. In addition, ThoughtSpot has many built-in security mechanisms to help prevent spoofing, hijacking, and SQL injection attacks, and it actively tests and responds to new threats with monthly updates.

=== Application Security
The ThoughtSpot Cloud environment is hosted in a multi-tenant configuration providing separation of users, data, and metadata across customers.

== Data security

=== Encryption at rest

ThoughtSpot provides standard Encryption at Rest (EAR) for storage encryption.
This includes centralized key management, key rotation, and key revocation.
