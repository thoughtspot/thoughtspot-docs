You can add reference questions and business terms to coaching from within a conversation. To enable this feature, contact your administrator.

For Spotter Agent:

To add a particular question or phrase to Spotter Coach, click *+ Add to Coaching* below the Answer.


The *Confirm reference question* modal appears. The default reference question is your most recent question. You can edit the reference question in the provided text box to refine your coaching, and click *Confirm and Continue*.

The *Review business terms and mapped search tokens* modal appears. You can accept or reject the business terms mapped to the provided search tokens, or ignore them if the term is not useful to your coaching. Click *Done* to finish.

For Spotter Classic:

To coach Spotter from an incorrect Answer, click the *x* icon next to *Did Spotter interpret your question correctly* at the bottom of the Answer. You can edit the underlying search, save, and review the search query tokens making up the Answer. Only terms that you select *Accept* or *Reject* for will be saved by the system; terms you pass over will not be saved. Click *Submit* to save.

If you mark an Answer correct by clicking the checkmark icon, you can review and save the underlying search query tokens so Spotter remembers your choices in the future for similar questions. Only terms that you select *Accept* or *Reject* for will be saved by the system; terms you pass over will not be saved. Click *Submit* to save.
