[#threshold-based-alert]


Using threshold alerts, you can receive alerts when your KPI reaches a set value. For example, create a condition to receive an alert when your Sales KPI becomes `greater than 200,000`, or when your KPI for Sales weekly `increases by 2%`.

Note that ThoughtSpot checks your threshold condition against the value displayed in your KPI chart at the time period you define. If your KPI temporarily satisfies the threshold condition, but does not satisfy the condition at the time the threshold condition is next checked, you will not receive an alert notification.

NOTE: You can create alerts directly from watchlist KPIs on the home page.

To create a threshold-based notification for changes in your KPI, follow these steps:

. Select the KPI you want to monitor, either by accessing a Liveboard, or by searching within the **Answers** tab. +
Optionally, create a KPI and save it as an Answer, then select **Create alert** from the **more options** menu.
. Hover over the KPI visualization and select the **Monitor** icon. +

. The pop-up **Select an alert type** window appears.

. Select *KPI crosses a set limit*. Click *Next*.

. [Optional] Enter the name of your alert under *Alert name*.
. Under *Alert condition*, select the mathematical operator for your KPI alert:
* Greater than
* Greater than or equal to
* Less than
* Less than or equal to
* Equal to
* Not equal to
+
[NOTE]
====
If your KPI includes a time-series keyword (such as `weekly`), you may also select the following options for percentage changes in your KPI within the defined time bucket:

* Changes by (%)
* Increases by (%)
* Decreases by (%)
====
. Enter your threshold value. The exact value against which the selected threshold condition will be checked appears below the *Threshold value* entry.
. The default time interval to check for threshold conditions appears below the *Condition* entry.
. [Optional] Select *change* to manually schedule the frequency at which ThoughtSpot checks your KPI for the threshold condition. For example, you can schedule to check the KPI `Sales weekly` every week, every day, or every hour. Note that ThoughtSpot sends an alert if your KPI reaches the threshold condition at the time that it is checked. If a KPI temporarily reaches your threshold condition but no longer satisfies that condition when threshold check is scheduled, you _will not_ receive an alert.

. Select the notification channel, either *Email* or *Custom channel*. Custom channel notifications can be configured with the use of webhooks.

. Your name automatically appears under **Subscribers**. Enter the names of one or more teammates to subscribe them to your KPI alert schedule.
+
NOTE: You must have _view_ access to the data source underlying the KPI to schedule notifications for teammates who also have _view_ access to the data source. You must have _edit_ access to the data source underlying the KPI to schedule notifications for teammates regardless of whether they have access to the data source.


. [Optional] Select the checkbox next to *Add custom message* and type your custom message in the text box.

. [Optional] Select *View KPI query* or scroll down to see the details of the query that defines your KPI.
. Select *Create alert*.
. The *Add view access* window appears. If you have added subscribers to your KPI alert that do not have view access to the underlying data source, you can remove them from your KPI alert or give them view access here.
+
NOTE: Row-level security applies to your KPI alert subscriptions. For example, if you create a threshold-based alert for a KPI on `Sales` in all regions, you receive a notification when total sales reaches your defined threshold. Another user subscribed to your alert whose access is limited to the "West" region would receive an alert _only_ when sales in the "West" region reached the threshold defined in your alert.

. Select *Done*.
