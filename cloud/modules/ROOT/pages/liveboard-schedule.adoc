With scheduled Liveboard email updates, you can analyze your data offline and share Liveboards with your colleagues, including people who may not have a ThoughtSpot account.

You can add multiple schedules with different configurations for a single Liveboard.
However, each job is limited to one Liveboard schedule. Any user can create a Liveboard schedule for themselves.
To add or modify a schedule for other users and groups, you must either be an administrator or have the *can schedule for others* privilege, and at least edit-only and view-only access to the Liveboard.

CAUTION: Scheduled Liveboards support up to 80 visualizations. Including more than 80 can cause schedules and downloads to fail.

== Liveboard schedule email format
The format of the scheduled Liveboard email is the following. You can customize aspects of the scheduled Liveboard email, such as the email address ThoughtSpot sends it from, from the *Onboarding* section of the Admin Console. Refer to xref:onboarding-email-settings.adoc[].

Sender:: admin <+no-reply@notification.thoughtspot.com+>
Subject:: <Liveboard name> update
Body::

+
*View Liveboard* button
Attachment(s)::

== Scheduling a Liveboard

NOTE: You can use the new faster and more intuitive Liveboard scheduling experience. To enable this new experience, contact your ThoughtSpot administrator.

To schedule a Liveboard, follow these steps:

. Navigate to the Liveboard you want to create a schedule for.
. Select the *Create schedule* from the *More* menu image:icon-more-10px.png[more options menu icon] to create a new schedule. To modify an existing schedule, select *Manage schedule* from the *More* menu image:icon-more-10px.png[more options menu icon].

. In the *Create schedule* window, set the values for your schedule.
+
Name::
Provide a short name for this schedule. This name should be descriptive and unique. This section does not appear in the Liveboard schedule email.
Add comment::
Select *Add comment* to add a description that will appear as *Description: <your content>* in the Liveboard schedule email. Enter a description to remind yourself and to inform others. If this is an important schedule for a meeting or a report, you should mention that.
[#frequency]
Frequency::
You can rebuild a Liveboard every _n_ minutes, hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly. For some of these, you can also choose specific times of the day or days of the week.
+
If you schedule a Liveboard to repeat every _n_ hours (for example: every 3 hours), ThoughtSpot bases the schedule on the start of the day (00:00) in your time zone, rather than when the schedule was created. For example, if you set a schedule at 8:14 PM for every 3 hours, ThoughtSpot sends it to you at 9:00 PM, 12:00 AM, 3:00 AM, and so on.
+
For schedules set to repeat every _n_ minutes (where _n_ can be 5, 10, 15, 20, or 30), ThoughtSpot sends the Liveboard at regular intervals starting at the beginning of each hour in your time zone. For example, an every-20-minutes schedule created at 8:14 PM will run at 8:20 PM, 8:40 PM, 9:00 PM, 9:20 PM, and so on.
+
The exception to this is schedules which run every 45 minutes. These trigger at the start of every hour and again at 45 minutes past the hour. For example, an every-45-minutes schedule created at 8:14 PM will run at 8:45 PM, 9:00 PM, 9:45 PM. 10:00 PM, and so on.
Type::
* *PDF files* show all visualizations in the Liveboard. Each chart uses a page in the file; tables show only the first 100 rows of a table. Use PDF files to skim the data. The Liveboard schedule email contains 1 PDF with the entire Liveboard.
** *Show advanced PDF settings* allows you to specify the Liveboard layout in *PDF* format, and which visualizations and tabs to include. For more details about the layout options, refer to xref:liveboard-download-pdf.adoc[].


* *CSV files* provide all data for tables, with one attachment for each table. If your Liveboard has 3 tables and 4 charts, the Liveboard schedule email contains 3 CSVs, one for each table, and no content on the charts in the Liveboard. Use CSV files to perform further analysis offline. Pivot tables are not included.
** Refer to xref:schedule-liveboards.adoc#format[Format of scheduled Liveboards] for more information about the differences between CSV, XLSX, and PDF attachments in a scheduled Liveboard email.
* *XLSX files* provide all data for tables, with an Excel attachment for each table. If your Liveboard has 3 tables and 4 charts, the Liveboard schedule email contains 3 XLSX files, one for each table, and no content on the charts in the Liveboard. Use XLSX files to share information and perform further analysis offline in Excel. Pivot tables are not included.
** Refer to xref:schedule-liveboards.adoc#format[Format of scheduled Liveboards] for more information about the differences between CSV, XLSX, and PDF attachments in a scheduled Liveboard email.

[NOTE]
====
Liveboard schedule pdf/csv/xlsx sent via emails is stored in the cluster until either of the following conditions are met:

* The cluster is restarted.
* When there is another scheduled run for a Liveboard, all pdfs older than 24 hrs for that Liveboard are cleared.
====

Email body:: Enter an optional comment to be included in the scheduled Liveboard email.

Gating condition::
Write a statement that returns a single boolean value (`true` or `false`). For example, `sum (revenue) > 100` is a valid condition, but `is_weekend (commit_date)` is not, since it returns a result per row of data. Use any data source (table, Model, or view) that you have access to for the gating condition. However, note that for reports sent to ThoughtSpot users, ThoughtSpot executes the query as that specific user so that it respects row-level security (RLS) and ensures data security. If you schedule the Liveboard for 3 users, and 1 user does not have access to the data source in the gating condition, the gating condition fails and ThoughtSpot does not send the Liveboard to that 1 user. It does send the Liveboard to the 2 users who do have data access. For reports sent to people who are not ThoughtSpot users, ThoughtSpot executes the query as the author of the Liveboard schedule. The gating condition will still work if you are using passthrough security for your external data warehouse connection. The gating condition formula and any tables you use in it do not need to be related to the Liveboard the gating condition is for. You can use any valid formula in your statement. ThoughtSpot checks the formula syntax, but does not validate if the formula returns a valid single boolean.
+
At the scheduled time, ThoughtSpot executes the gating condition query. If the condition evaluates to `true`, ThoughtSpot processes the Liveboard.
+
For a list of valid formulas, see xref:formula-reference.adoc[Formula function reference].
+
For an in-depth example of a scenario where a gating condition is useful and powerful, refer to xref:liveboard-gating-condition-example.adoc[].
Recipients::
You are limited to 1000 recipients for each job. You can add *Users* or *groups*. Use *Emails* to add recipients who are not ThoughtSpot users. Your ThoughtSpot admin must set these email domains as allowed domains in advance. Contact {support-url} to add allowed domains.
+
If you experience problems with sending email, your cluster may not have SMTP enabled. Contact your system administrator to resolve this issue.
+
To disable sending emails to recipients outside ThoughtSpot, contact {support-url}.
+
NOTE: You must have *can schedule for others* privileges to add other recipients to your Liveboard schedule.

Views::
You can select a view to be scheduled instead of the standard Liveboard. When selected, the filters and parameters are updated to reflect the values set in the view.

[start=4]
. Select *Save* to schedule your Liveboard.

[#pdf-width]
== Change scheduled PDF width

By default, scheduled Liveboards in PDF format have a width of 1920 px, which supports most Liveboard visualizations and layouts. To change this default width to a different width in pixels for your company, contact {support-url}. For example, if most users in your company view ThoughtSpot in full screen, request that ThoughtSpot set the Liveboard PDF width to the full screen width.
