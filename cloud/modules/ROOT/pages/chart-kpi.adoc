:description: Use the KPI chart to display important metrics to support your business use case(s).


You can now create visualizations of your data’s Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). Using this feature, you can track the changes in important KPIs in your data. When you configure the KPI chart to suit your business use case, you can save it as an answer, add it to a Liveboard to increase visibility, or create alerts to receive notifications on the changes in the KPI using the xref:monitor.adoc[**Monitor** feature].

When you search a single measure (e.g. “Sales”), ThoughtSpot automatically creates a KPI chart displaying the numeric value of that measure. If you search multiple measures, you can configure the measure visualized in your KPI chart. To tailor the KPI visualization to your business use case, you can add time comparison keywords such as “weekly” or “monthly” to change the aggregation of your KPI, and use the chart configuration menu to decide how much information to display.

== Configure visualized measures

If you search multiple measures, the KPI chart automatically displays only the first measure. To create a KPI chart based on another measure from your search, click the *chart configuration* icon image:icon-gear-10px.png[] and select the new measure from the *Not visualized* section. Drag and drop it into the *Measure* section. If you include time column (columns of type Date, Datetime, Timestamp and Time) or time period keyword (Hourly, Daily, Weekly, etc.) in your search, the keyword appears in the *Time axis* section.

=== Time-series aggregation in KPIs

If you search a measure with a keyword comparing across time periods, for example, `Sales weekly`, your KPI visualization displays data corresponding to the most recent date bucket associated with your search, and the percent increase or decrease in that data from the previous data point.

In the following example, the total sales for the week of 02/21/2022 was 3.21M. This measure increased 0.2% compared to the total sales for the previous week, 3.2M. Here, “WoW” signifies that the KPI aggregates by week, or “week-over-week”. You can also search a measure by day (DoD), month (MoM), quarter (QoQ), or year (YoY).

NOTE: You can only create KPI charts with data arranged in ascending, or chronological, order. You cannot create a KPI chart from any search using “date descending” as a filter.

=== Sparkline visualization for time-series KPIs

When you search for a measure with a time-series keyword, for example `Sales monthly`, your KPI chart automatically displays a sparkline visualization of all the data points defined in your query. For ease of comparison, the two most recent data points are highlighted in the sparkline visualization. When the date bucket defined by your query is in progress (for example, a `sales weekly` KPI you consult on a Wednesday), your sparkline visualization shows a dotted line between the last data point and the accumulated number so far.

Hover over the sparkline visualization to see the exact value of the metric and corresponding date for each data point.

=== Configure KPI display options

When you create a KPI chart with a time period keyword, you can change the display options before saving as an answer or pinning to a Liveboard.

Click the *chart configuration icon* image:icon-gear-10px.png[] and select *Settings* to make the following display changes:

- *Show date label* to display or hide the date label.
- *Show Sparkline* to display or hide the time-series visualization.
- *Comparison* to display or hide the percentage change since the last period selected.
- *Positive change color* to change the color of the percentage increase label.
- *Negative change color* to change the color of the percentage decrease label.


== Monitor your KPI

When you pin a KPI visualization to a Liveboard or save it as an answer, you can now create alerts to receive notifications for yourself and others. You must have **view** access to the KPI’s data source to schedule notifications for yourself. You must have **edit** access to the underlying data source to schedule notifications for teammates regardless of whether they have access.

For more information on the **Monitor** feature, see xref:monitor.adoc[Monitor Key Performance Indicators in your data].
