:description: With custom charts, you can add your own custom charts to ThoughtSpot.
:jira: SCAL-179003, SCAL-202002, SCAL-214870

You can now use custom charts created outside of ThoughtSpot.

This article describes how you use a custom chart and how your ThoughtSpot administrator can add, edit, and delete custom charts.

Developers create custom charts in Javascript using charting libraries such as https://www.highcharts.com/[Highcharts^]. For more information, refer to https://github.com/thoughtspot/ts-chart-sdk/blob/main/README.md/[ThoughtSpot Charts SDK documentation^].

To enable custom charts, you must contact {support-url}.

== Administering custom charts

A ThoughtSpot administrator can add custom charts to your cluster, as well as edit and delete them. Before adding custom charts, the administrator must add the domains where the custom chart and chart icon are hosted to the list of permitted iFrame and CSP img-src domains in ThoughtSpot. Without performing this step, the custom chart cannot be loaded.

=== Adding domains to the permitted iFrame and CSP img-src domains

The ThoughtSpot administrator must enter the domain for both the chart and the chart icon.

To add the domain for a custom chart and chart icon, do the following:

. Select *Develop* from the navigation bar.
. Navigate to *All Orgs* > *Security settings*.
. Click *Edit*.
. In the *Permitted iFrame domains* field enter the domain where the custom chart is hosted.
. In the *CSP img-src domains* field enter the domain where the custom chart icon is hosted.
. Click *Save Changes*.


=== Adding a custom chart to a ThoughtSpot cluster

To add a custom chart, the ThoughtSpot administrator does the following:

. Select *Admin* in the top navigation bar.
. Under _Application settings_, Select *Chart customization*.
. Select the *Custom charts* tab.

The Add custom chart window appears.
