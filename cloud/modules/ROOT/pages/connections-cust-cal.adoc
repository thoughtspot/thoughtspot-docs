With a custom calendar, you can choose when the year, quarter, or week starts, and search using date-related keywords.

You can create custom calendars for different purposes within your company, including:

* Retail calendars, like 4-4-5, 4-5-4, or 5-4-4
* Fiscal calendars, where the year or quarter starts on a different date each year
* Pharmaceutical calendars, where the week runs from Friday through Thursday
* Calendars in different languages

== Options

In a custom calendar, you can set the following:

* The starting date of a year
* The starting dates of quarters
* The starting day of the month
* The starting day of the week
* The words used for the days of the week, months and quarters

== Custom calendar versus standard calendar

ThoughtSpot uses the link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_week_date[ISO week date system^] to define the standard calendar. This means that the fiscal year contains 52 or 53 full weeks, with Monday defined as the start of the week.

When January 1st falls on a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday, it is defined as part of week 01. If January 1st falls on a Friday, it is part of week 53 of the previous year. If it falls on a Saturday, it is part of the last week of the previous year (week 52 in a regular year and week 53 in a leap year). If it falls on a Sunday, it is part of week 52 of the previous year.

There are many reasons users may choose to set up a custom calendar rather than using the default calendar. These may include:

* Changing the start of the week from Monday to another day
* Setting up alternative calendar types
* Introducing granular control for when dates should be included in date boundaries such as weeks, months, quarters, or years

* Using date formulas with the `fiscal` option specified (See xref:formulas-date.adoc#fiscal-and-gregorian-calendars[Fiscal and Gregorian calendars])
* Overriding the calendar used in the search bar by typing your custom calendar's name
* Binding a calendar with a column under the table detail page.
Example: Binding `Lineorder` `commitdate` with the French calendar.
* Specifying a calendar in the formula

== Limitations

Before you create a custom calendar, make sure to review the following limitations.

=== Creating a custom calendar

* ThoughtSpot doesn't support month offset when creating a custom calendar using the: 4-4-5, 4-5-4, or 5-4-4 calendar type configurations. Month offset is a separate calendar type.
* When uploading files, the date format must be _MM/DD/YYYY_. No other formats are supported.
* The file must be sorted based on the date in ascending order.
* The file format should be UTF-8.
* You can now add row-level security rules to custom calendars. To enable this feature, contact {support-url}.

=== Using a custom calendar

* Formulas are limited to defining a single custom calendar.
* *VS* supports multiple custom calendars as long as there is only a single calendar per clause.


=== Updating a custom calendar

The values in the generated calendar table can be updated to meet your specific business requirements. Before updating your calendar, be aware of the following:

* `day_of_week`, `month`, `quarter`, and `year` are defined as varchar columns. The expected values are strings rather than numbers. If numbers are defined, the value may not be displayed as an indexed option.
+
Examples:

** `day_of_week: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday` rather than `day_of_week: 1, 2, 3`
** `quarter: Q1, Q2` rather than `quarter: 1, 2`
** `end_of_``[_period_]``\_epoch` value should be the same as the `start_of_``[_period_]``_epoch` value for the next period. This is because the code is greater than or equal to the start value and less than the end value.

IMPORTANT: If you update a range of dates in the underlying table, you must manually refresh the custom calendar in ThoughtSpot by running the update command.

To update your custom calendar, do the following:

. Sign in to your ThoughtSpot cluster.
. Select *Data* in the top navigation bar.
+
The Data workspace appears.
. Click *Utilities*.
. Click *Add/modify custom calendar*.
. Click the *More* menu image:icon-more-10px.png[more options menu icon] for the custom calendar you want to update and select *Update Calendar*.

== Prerequisites

* For a user to create a custom calendar, they must have the required permissions to create a table in the database used in the connection where they want to create their custom calendar.
