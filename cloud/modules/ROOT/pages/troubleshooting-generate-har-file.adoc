:description: Generate a HAR file to send to ThoughtSpot Support for troubleshooting.

When you log a support ticket that references unexpected behavior in the web user interface, {support-url} often asks for a HAR file from the browser. The HAR file captures details about what's happening in the UI when the error occurs, including network requests happening in the browser. If you can replicate the error, you can expedite ThoughtSpot troubleshooting. Capture a HAR file of the error, and attach it to the case when you log the support ticket.
