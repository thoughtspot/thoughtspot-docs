By default, the Select tables page appears.
You have the option, though, to change the connection name and update the connection details, by selecting the appropriate option at the top of the screen, making any changes needed and selecting *Continue* to go to the next page.

[#validate-metadata]
== Validate metadata

You can now validate connections to discover any changes in metadata after the connection was created. When you validate a connection, ThoughtSpot provides a JSON file containing details on any metadata changes. Once alerted to a metadata change, you can use TML to update the connection.

To validate your connection:

. Select *Data* in the top navigation bar.

. Open the *Connections* tab in the left navigation bar.

. Select the name of the connection you want to validate.

. Select the *more options* menu icon image:icon-more-10px.png[ellipsis icon] and click *Validate*.

. If ThoughtSpot detects any changes to the connection's metadata, the following message appears: "Your connection is not valid and requires metadata changes. You can download the list of changes affecting this connection by clicking on the button below."
+
To download the change log, click *Download metadata change log*. The change log automatically downloads to your browser's Downloads folder in JSON format.


To remove a table from a connection, you must delete it from the connection details page.

See the xref:connections-teradata-reference.adoc[{connection} connection reference] for details of connection parameters.
