:description: ThoughtSpot has added RBAC support to allow for a more granular distribution of privileges.

ThoughtSpot Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) helps an administrator manage roles and privileges that are assigned to users and groups in ThoughtSpot.  A role is a collection of privileges. A privilege allows users to perform certain actions while preventing them from performing other actions. RBAC enhances the granularity of permissions that determine the access and capabilities of users and admins.
//insert graphic that shows the roles assigned to groups

Roles can be assigned to groups.
A group can have one or more roles assigned to it.
When multiple roles are assigned to a group, the privileges available to users within that group are a union of the privileges in each role assigned to the group.

RBAC is disabled by default. To enable this feature, contact ThoughtSpot Support.

CAUTION: Once you enable RBAC it cannot be disabled.



== Roles and privileges

//Why would you use roles vs. groups?

A role is a collection of privileges. The role and its assigned privileges list the actions that can be performed, such as Can administer ThoughtSpot or Can upload user data. Roles can be high-level, like Super Admin, or specific based on your organization’s structure and requirements. Roles are configured and then assigned to groups. For more information about groups, see xref:groups-privileges.adoc[Understand groups and privileges].

ThoughtSpot delivers some standard roles to help you transition to RBAC. You can also create custom roles with custom privileges based on your organizational needs. The following are the standard roles delivered with ThoughtSpot.

//For example,

The following table shows existing ThoughtSpot group privileges and the new more granular RBAC roles introduced with ThoughtSpot 9.5.0.cl.

//(assigned to admin group after RBAC migration)
Previously, administrators were part of the administrator group. Members of this group could manage users, groups, and had view and edit access to all data. In some organizations these functions are broken out in a more granular way between different users. Roles allow you to assign the specific roles and privileges required without including those that are not needed. ThoughtSpot RBAC includes a Super Admin role that includes all of the privileges previously included in the Administrator group to help you migrate to RBAC. Users with this privilege can access all cluster data. This privilege should only be granted in exceptional circumstances.

=== RBAC roles
The following are descriptions of each of the RBAC roles.

|===
|Role |Description

== Migrating to RBAC
Existing ThoughtSpot customers can easily migrate to RBAC using the roles delivered with ThoughtSpot 9.5.0.cl. ThoughtSpot delivers roles corresponding to each privilege previously available as part of the existing groups and groups are retained. This allows you to assign those privileges individually to groups using roles.

== Create, edit, or delete a role
ThoughtSpot has customizable RBAC management for assigning privileges to roles.
Before adding users to groups, you can create custom roles if necessary and assign them to groups. Each role  includes a set of privileges for its users.
