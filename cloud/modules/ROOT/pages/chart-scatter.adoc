:description: The scatter chart is useful for finding correlations or outliers in your data.

Scatter charts display your data as a collection of points, which can either be evenly or unevenly distributed.
Each point is plotted based on its own axes values.
This helps you determine if there is a relationship between your searched columns.

Your search needs at least one attribute and one measure to be represented as a scatter chart.
