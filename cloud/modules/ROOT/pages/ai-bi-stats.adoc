:description: Use the AI and BI System Liveboard Liveboard to understand the user query consumption,allowing users to tally this data with their cloud data warehouse queries.
:jira: SCAL-260476


Use the AI and BI System Liveboard in ThoughtSpot Cloud to monitor query usage and analyst activities across all Orgs. It joins Query Stats with Analyst Studio data to provide comprehensive visibility into product usage, adoption, and billable queries.

Metrics are directly tied to query logs, reducing ambiguity and ensuring precise reporting.
Use this Liveboard to understand daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, annual and total active query users, monthly objects volume and so on. You must have admin privileges to view this Liveboard.


Users with admin privileges can share system Liveboards, such as the *AI and BI System Liveboard*, with other users who do not have admin privileges. However, be aware that you may be sharing sensitive user-level information, such as the names of objects that a user accessed.

To view this Liveboard:

. Go to the *Admin* tab.
. Choose *System Activities*.
. Select the *AI and BI Stats*.


//If your organization uses xref:orgs-overview.adoc[multi-tenancy with Orgs], ensure that you are in the Primary Org, in the *All orgs* section of the Admin Console.
//Alternatively, search for the Liveboard in the *Search Answers and Liveboards* search bar.
