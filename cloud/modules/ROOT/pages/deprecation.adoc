:description: In this article, we give you advance notice of features we are discontinuing in future releases.

ThoughtSpot sometimes deprecates and then removes existing features, replacing them with new and more effective ways to use our products.
In this article, we provide a list of features we've chosen to deprecate or remove in each release.

ThoughtSpot _deprecates_ some existing features, and then _removes_ them. These terms mean two different things.

Deprecated::
A deprecated feature still exists in the product, for backward compatibility, but there is a plan to remove it in a later release. Deprecated features do not receive ongoing support from ThoughtSpot.
+
We recommend that you stop using deprecated features as soon as possible, and change your workflows to use the new, improved functionality instead.

Removed::
A removed feature no longer exists in the product. When you upgrade to a newer release, any workflows that rely on a removed feature no longer work.

////
Use following notes above feature that is deprecated. Send a link back to this document for a fuller description.
NOTE: This feature is now deprecated. You may not use it starting with release 7.1. For details, see xref:deprecation.adoc[Deprecation Announcements].

== Removed in 9.5.0.cl

The 9.5.0.cl release of ThoughtSpot Cloud, targeted for July 2023 (GA), will remove the following feature:

Page numbers in downloaded Liveboard PDFs::
Beginning in the 9.5.0.cl release, you will no longer see an option to include page numbers when you download a Liveboard PDF. This change ensures that Liveboard PDF downloads do not result in timeout errors.

== Deprecated in 9.4.0.cl

The 9.4.0.cl release of ThoughtSpot Cloud, targeted for June 2023 (GA), will drop support for the following feature:

Pin Headlines:: ThoughtSpot will deprecate the pin Headline to Liveboard feature. Beginning in the 9.4.0.cl Cloud release, users will no longer see the pin icon when they select table summaries. To visualize and pin single aggregated measures, attributes in string/date format, or time-series metrics with sparklines, we recommend creating xref:chart-kpi.adoc[KPI charts]. Existing Headlines pinned to Liveboards will not be affected in this release.

== Removed in 9.2.0.cl

The 9.2.0.cl release of ThoughtSpot Cloud, targeted for April 2023 (GA), will remove the following feature:

Include and exclude values in Liveboard visualizations::
ThoughtSpot will remove the *Include only <value>* and *Exclude <value>* options in the contextual menu for Liveboard visualizations. These options are still available for Liveboard visualizations in xref:answer-explorer.adoc[Explore mode]. They are also available when you are searching data or viewing an Answer.




== Deprecated in 8.3.0.cl
The 8.3.0.cl release of ThoughtSpot Cloud, targeted for April 2022 (GA), will *deprecate* the following features. ThoughtSpot will drop support for this feature in a later release.

== Removed in 8.2.0.cl (March Cloud)

The 8.2.0.cl (March Cloud) release of ThoughtSpot Cloud, targeted for March 2022 (GA), will drop support for the following feature:

Business user onboarding::
ThoughtSpot will replace the current business user onboarding (present in 8.1.0.cl and earlier) with a new onboarding flow.
The new onboarding flow directs new users to Search Assist, where they can complete sample searches on xref:search-assist.adoc[demo data] or xref:search-assist-coach.adoc[their company's data].

== Removed in 8.0.0.cl (January Cloud)

The 8.0.0.cl (January Cloud) release of ThoughtSpot Cloud, targeted for January 2022 (GA), will drop support for the following feature:

Liveboard follow::
In November Cloud 2021 and earlier, there are two different ways for a user to ask ThoughtSpot to email them a Liveboard PDF on a specified schedule.
You can follow the Liveboard, or xref:liveboard-schedule.adoc[schedule a Liveboard job].
+
In 8.0.0.cl (January Cloud) and later releases, ThoughtSpot will combine these features into a single action called "Schedule." The *Follow* option will not be available.
This change will allow any user to schedule their own Liveboard emails.
To send Liveboard emails to other users, you still need the xref:privileges-end-user.adoc#schedule-pinboards[*can schedule for others* permission].
+
ThoughtSpot will migrate any existing Liveboard follows to Liveboard schedules.
If you followed a Liveboard in November Cloud or earlier, you will see it in the list of Liveboard schedules for that Liveboard as _Migrated from follow (your display name)_.

Multiple join path resolution within the formula editor or a search::
When you try to search on columns with more than one possible join path, the system no longer allows you to define the join path within the search.
Similarly, when you try to create a formula with columns with more than one possible join path, the system does not allow you to define the join path.
Instead, the system now prompts you to resolve this issue and avoid confusion or incorrect data by creating a Worksheet with the correct join path.
Send feedback::  The option to send product feedback, from the *more options* menu image:icon-more-10px.png[more options menu icon] on an Answer or search.
Client-side summaries for tables::
We consolidated column summaries and headlines into one summary, called a headline summary. To calculate these headline summaries, ThoughtSpot executes one SQL query for each summary against the underlying database.
These headline summaries are integrated with the table columns.
You can pin them to Pinboards.

This feature allowed users to ask a designated expert on a particular data source for help when they run into an issue with an Answer or search they created on that data source.
