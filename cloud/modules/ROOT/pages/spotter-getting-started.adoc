== Understanding Spotter


To make it easier to understand how Spotter answers your questions, we surface the search query information in the form of the Answer title and search tokens used to construct the answer. When you ask a follow-up question, Spotter highlights the changes it made in search tokens to answer your question. You can also hover over formulas to see how theyâ€™re calculated, and edit them within Spotter.

You can click a point on the Answer to drill down by different attributes directly from an answer in a conversation or while in edit mode




You can see sample rows of the underlying Worksheet to get a sense of what columns are in the dataset and how the sample rows look by clicking *Preview data*. Note that Preview data is not available for Worksheets with chasm or fan traps.

Spotter treats successive questions in a conversation as a follow-up. If you want to ask a question to start a new analysis, click the *Reset* button. On the Home page, reset lets you start from a fresh question on the selected data source. On a Liveboard, reset takes you back to the original visualization.


== Coach Spotter


You can coach Spotter from the Data Workspace by addressing feedback given on AI-generated Answers, both by specific business terms and by complete reference questions. This capability, previously called xref:sage-coach.adoc[Sage Coach], allows you to refine the way Spotter responds to questions. When users with Worksheet edit privileges provide feedback, the feedback level is global by default.

NOTE: Enabling Spotter will not impact any of your past feedback coaching. All existing feedback entries will persist and seamlessly transition into Coach Spotter, organized under the newly introduced tabs: 'Reference Question' and 'Business Term'. Your feedback data remains fully intact and accessible.

=== Coach Spotter within a conversation

You can now give feedback on AI-generated Answers in Spotter without interrupting your searching conversation.

To coach Spotter from an incorrect Answer, click the *x* icon next to *Did Spotter interpret your question correctly* at the bottom of the Answer. You can edit the underlying search, save, and review the search query tokens making up the Answer. Only terms that you select *Accept* or *Reject* for will be saved by the system; terms you pass over will not be saved. Click *Submit* to save.

If you mark an Answer correct by clicking the checkmark icon, you can review and save the underlying search query tokens so Spotter remembers your choices in the future for similar questions. Only terms that you select *Accept* or *Reject* for will be saved by the system; terms you pass over will not be saved. Click *Submit* to save.
