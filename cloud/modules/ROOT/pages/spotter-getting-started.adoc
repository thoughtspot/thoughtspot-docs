Spotter is our new AI-powered search experience which uses GPT-3.5T, GPT-4T and GPT-4o, with the large language models (LLM) of Microsoft https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/cognitive-services/openai/data-privacy?context=%2Fazure%2Fcognitive-services%2Fopenai%2Fcontext%2Fcontext[Azure OpenAI Service^] and Google Gemini.

== Understanding Spotter
.Spotter shortcuts [.badge.badge-early-access-whats-new]#Early Access#
****
Enable Spotter shortcuts to select from existing verified data constructs, including columns, filter values, and search data keywords. These shortcuts allow you to mix natural language and deterministic inputs when using Spotter. Create more precise questions by referencing actual column names and values from their Models.

NOTE: Values only appear if indexing is enabled. If indexing is not enabled, you see only column names and select ThoughtSpot keywords, weekdays, and system variables.

To enable Spotter shortcuts, contact {support-url}.

To use Spotter shortcuts, do the following:

. In the Spotter question box, type *@* to enter lookup mode.
. Select from the list of available columns, filter values, and search data keywords, then start your search.
****

To make it easier to understand how Spotter answers your questions, we surface the search query information in the form of the Answer title and search tokens used to construct the answer. When you ask a follow-up question, Spotter highlights the changes it made in search tokens to answer your question. You can also hover over formulas to see how theyâ€™re calculated, and edit them within Spotter.

Spotter treats successive questions in a conversation as a follow-up. If you want to ask a question to start a new analysis, click the *Reset* button. On the Home page, reset lets you start from a fresh question on the selected data source. On a Liveboard, reset takes you back to the original visualization.


[#quick-edits]
== Spotter quick edits

You can click tokens in a Spotter answer to edit them for clarity, such as specifying whether a measure should be classified as count or unique count, or changing the column being used as an attribute.

//In certain cases, Spotter may show a warning in the answer tokens. If a data set contains multiple columns with similar names, or if it's unclear whether you want a count or a unique count of a measure, for example, Spotter may ask you to clarify its interpretation of your query. Note that you can also click on tokens that do not show a warning and edit them.

To edit a Spotter Answer's tokens, follow these steps:

. Click on a Spotter token.

. A review window pops up, showing options to clarify Spotter's interpretation of your question. Measures allow you to change the aggregation type (for example, from `sum` to `average`) and column, while attributes let you change the column. You can change filters like dates from `rolling` to `fixed` or change the date bucket (for example, from one year to one month).

. Click *Apply*. The Answer updates to show the changes you made.


== Coach Spotter


You can coach Spotter from the Data Workspace by addressing feedback given on AI-generated Answers, both by specific business terms and by complete reference questions. This capability, previously called xref:sage-coach.adoc[Sage Coach], allows you to refine the way Spotter responds to questions. When users with Model edit privileges provide feedback, the feedback level is global by default.

NOTE: Enabling Spotter will not impact any of your past feedback coaching. All existing feedback entries will persist and seamlessly transition into Coach Spotter, organized under the newly introduced tabs: 'Reference Question' and 'Business Term'. Your feedback data remains fully intact and accessible.

To coach Spotter from an incorrect Answer, click the *x* icon next to *Did Spotter interpret your question correctly* at the bottom of the Answer. You can edit the underlying search, save, and review the search query tokens making up the Answer. Only terms that you select *Accept* or *Reject* for will be saved by the system; terms you pass over will not be saved. Click *Submit* to save.

If you mark an Answer correct by clicking the checkmark icon, you can review and save the underlying search query tokens so Spotter remembers your choices in the future for similar questions. Only terms that you select *Accept* or *Reject* for will be saved by the system; terms you pass over will not be saved. Click *Submit* to save.
