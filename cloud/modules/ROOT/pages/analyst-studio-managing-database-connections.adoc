== Overview

You can connect as many private databases to your {product} Workspace as you like.
{product} supports connecting to most popular types of relational databases.
When you connect a database to your {product} Workspace, by default all members of your Workspace will be able to run queries against that data connection.

//All Workspaces are also automatically connected to the <<mode-public-warehouse,{product} Public Warehouse>>.

== Private data connections

=== Connect a new database

To connect your database to your {product} organization:

. Click the app switcher icon in the top navigation bar and select *{product}*.
. Click on your name in the upper left corner of the screen.
. Click *Connect a Database*.
. Follow the instructions to connect your database.

Learn more about xref:analyst-studio-connecting-analyst-studio-to-your-database.adoc[how {product} connects] to private databases.

IMPORTANT: Any active member of an {product} Workspace can create a new database connection. By default, new database connections may be queried by all members of the Workspace. To restrict non-admin access to a data source, you can <<limit-access-to-a-data-connection-in-mode,limit access to it to specific users>>.

=== Modify or disconnect a connected database

You can only delete or modify the settings and credentials for a database connection if you're an admin or if you were the member who connected it to the Workspace.

. Click the app switcher icon in the top navigation bar and select *{product}*.
. Click on your name in the upper left, and click *Workspace Settings*.
. In the Data section, click *Connections*.
. All the database connections for your Workspace are listed on the right.
. Click on the connection and then go to the *Connection Properties tab* to adjust the database credentials and configuration.
Click *Delete* to disconnect this database from {product}.
+
IMPORTANT: Deleting a database connection from {product} will prevent all Reports built using that connection from running until a new connection is selected. Deleting a database connection will not, however, have any effect on the database itself.

[#update-preferred-jdbc-driver]
=== Update preferred JDBC driver

To update the driver {product} uses to connect to one of your data sources, you must have the manage data source permission or higher.

. Open the menu beneath your name in the upper left corner and select *Workspace Settings*.

. Scroll down to the *Data* section and select *Manage Connections*.
In the main panel, select the connection you'd like to update from the list.
+
image:manage_connections.png[Manage Connections]
. Review and update the selected driver.
Details on all driver versions and known issues are documented for each database technology xref:analyst-studio-supported-databases.adoc#databases[below].
+
image:update_driver_manage_connections.png[Update Driver]
. Re-enter the password of the {product} database user or otherwise re-authenticate the credentials, then *Save changes*.
+
image:save_driver_update_changes.png[Enter Password]
. You should see a blue banner at the top of the screen indicating the connection properties have been updated.
+
image:driver_saved_ribbon.png[Data Source Saved]
. An error like the following indicates the username and password (or equivalent) must be re-entered before saving the driver changes.
+
image:driver_update_auth_fail_ribbon.png[Data Source Auth Fail]

=== Disable or enable automatic schema refresh

For admins and users with "manage" permission:

. In the Connections section, select a database connection to navigate to the settings.
. Toggle *Automatic Schema Refresh* off or on.
. Confirm and save changes to the connection properties.
Schema refresh will now be disabled or enabled.
. Manually refresh the schema with the button at the top of the page.

=== Trigger a schema refresh

{product}'s schema update frequency is daily at 3:05pm UTC (7:05am PST / 8:05am PDT based on daylight savings).
However, you can trigger a schema refresh at any time.

. In the SQL editor, click on the kebab menu next to your data source and select *Refresh*.
+
image:schema-browser-refresh.png[Schema Browser Refresh]
. You can also go to *Workspace Settings* in the menu beneath your name.
+
image:workplace-settings.png[Workplace Settings] +
Then go to *Manage Connections* under the Data section to select the data source.
Select the *Refresh schema* button in the top right corner.
+
image:manage-connections-refresh-schema.png[Manage Connections Refresh]

== Controlling access

=== Database user permissions

Most databases provide robust permission systems, which let you manage user roles to set detailed schema- and table-level permissions.
In {product}, your Workspace will access each data connection through a single user, which we recommend you or your database admin create expressly for use with {product}.

Members of your Workspace who use this data connection will be able to access the data source according to the permissions granted to this user in your database.
You can connect {product} to the same database multiple times via different database users, with varying levels of permissions.

There are various ways you can control the data that members of your Workspace can query in {product}.
One way is to leverage the permissions granted to the single user your Workspace relies upon to connect to a given database.
Limiting that user's permissions on the database side will, in turn, restrict the access of all members of your {product} Workspace for that data connection.

[#limit-access-to-a-data-connection-in-mode]
=== Limit access to a data connection in {product}
//+++<flag-icon>++++++</flag-icon>+++

Admins can also limit access to a data connection to specific non-admin users or user groups directly in {product}.
If a non-admin user does not have access to a connected database, that user will not be able to:

* Query the database or create, duplicate, edit, or schedule any Reports that query that database.
* Write or view any of that data connection's xref:analyst-studio-definitions.adoc[Definitions].
+
IMPORTANT: Admins in an {product} Workspace always have query access to all data connections in that Workspace.

*Setting the default connection access policy*

Connection admins can set the default connection access policy for everyone in their Workspace to have *View* or *Query* access to the connection, or choose to set up access to *None*.

[.bordered]
image::permissions.png[Connection Access Policy Illustration]

* The access type *View* allows all members to view content built on this connection.
* The access type *Query* allows all members to view and query this connection.

*Granting access type to groups and individuals*

In addition, you can grant *Query*, *View*, or *Manage* access to groups and individuals.

[.bordered]
image::Access-Menu.png[Access Menu Illustration]

To set up permissions to a connected database in {product}:

. Click the app switcher icon in the top navigation bar and select *{product}*.
. Click on your name in the upper left, and click *Workspace Settings*.
. In the Data section, click *Manage Connections*.
. Click on the data connection you want to limit.
. Click the *Permissions* tab.
. Click on *Connection Access Policy*, to set the default access type to *None*, *View*, or *Query*.
. To manually add users and user groups, click *Add members*.
In the pop-up box, click on each user or user group that you want to grant access to this connection.
. Once you click on the user or user group, you will have the option to grant *Query*, *View*, or *Manage* access.
. If you change your mind and want to remove that member, click on the user or user group, then click on the *Access Type* and choose *Remove Access*. Then confirm *Remove Access*.

=== How database permissions and {product} permissions interact
//+++<flag-icon>++++++</flag-icon>+++

Here's an example of how this setup might look for a company with a single database, connected to {product} via two different database user roles.

Note that these permissions only determine query access.
Users in your Workspace will be able to see a Report created with one of these data connections unless the Report is in a xref:analyst-studio-spaces.adoc#personal-space[private Collection].

[.bordered]
image::data-source-roles-with-query-access.png[Database roles with query access]

. In this simplified example, the company's database contains two tables: a marketing table and a finance table containing sensitive information.
. There are two user roles (managed at the database level):
 ** User Role #1 only has access to the marketing table.
 ** User Role #2 has access to both the marketing table and the finance table.
. When you xref:analyst-studio-connecting-analyst-studio-to-your-database.adoc[connect a database] to {product}, you do so using database user roles.
Each connection will appear as a different database in the schema browser.
Note that the default name will be the name of the database (for example, Redshift), but you can also name it based on a description of the access level or user role.
. Workspaces can also specify which {product} users have access to each connection.
 ** A user with query access to "`Marketing`" will ONLY be able to query the marketing table.
They will not have access to any sensitive financial information.
 ** A user with query access to "`All`" will be able to query the marketing and finance tables.

[#query-headers-and-footers]
== Query headers and footers
//+++<flag-icon>++++++</flag-icon>+++

{product} enables customers to annotate queries in two ways:

* {product} allows customers to define, using Liquid parameters and SQL, metadata attributes to be sent about each query.
This metadata can include {product} user or query attributes (for example, username, query runner group, or timestamp of query run).
{product} calls these query *headers*.
* {product} automatically appends a SQL comment to each query with the following static {product} user attributes: email, timestamp of query run, {product} query run URL, and a boolean value indicating whether the query was executed manually or scheduled.
{product} calls these query *footers*.

[#query-headers]
=== Query headers

Custom query headers allow admins to prepend queries with code that executes every time a query is run against the data connection.
Using custom query headers you can:

* Manage database load by giving services downstream of {product} context about who is running the query or why it is being run.
* Automatically set environment variables, such as default schemas and time zones.
* Add custom logging to each query that will appear in your database's logs.
+
IMPORTANT: Headers are injected only once per {product} SQL query, even if that query is split into multiple statements. Query headers appear as part of the syntax executed by the database. Query headers are not visible in {product}'s SQL Editor, but are viewable in a historical query run.

=== Modify a data connection's query header

You must be the creator of a data connection or a Workspace admin to modify its query header.

. Click the app switcher icon in the top navigation bar and select *{product}*.
. Click on your name in the upper left, and click *Workspace Settings*.
. In the Data section, click *Connections*.
. Click on the data connection you would like to modify.
. Go to the *Query Header* tab.
. In the space provided, add or modify any valid SQL code (including comments and valid Liquid code) that you want {product} to prepend to all queries run against this connection.
. When you are finished, click *Save*.

==== Variables

Each time a query is executed, {product} automatically defines a number of Liquid variables containing useful audit information.
You can reference these variables in your custom query headers to add audit information that will appear in your database's logs.
Both SQL and Liquid parameters are supported.
//See link:https://mode.com/blog/query-headers[our Blog,window=_blank]:

|===
| Variable | Output

| `{{ query_runner_email }}`
| Email address of the user running the query.

| `{{ query_runner_username }}`
| Username of the user running the query.

| `{{ query_runner_groups }}`
| Array of group tokens* for groups the runner is a part of.

| `{{ run_at }}`
| A Unix timestamp of when the query was run.

| `{{ is_scheduled }}`
| True if the query was run as part of a schedule;
false otherwise.

| `{{ query_run_url }}`
| URL containing the query token.

| `{{ report_run_url }}`
| URL containing the run token.
|===

_*Find a group's token by going to Settings > Groups > click a group. The token is a 12-character string at the end of the URL._

==== Examples

===== Assign scheduled queries to a different group in Redshift

[source,sql]
----
{% if is_scheduled == true %}
SET query_group TO scheduled_queries;
{% endif %}
----

===== Set a default schema

[source,sql]
----
SET SEARCH_PATH TO 'webapp';
----

===== Add comments with run date, type, and running user

This example is illustrated with a multi-statement query to show how headers and footers interact.

[source,sql]
----
-- Run by {{ query_runner_email }}
-- Run at {{ run_at }}
{% if is_scheduled == true %}
-- Scheduled run
{% else %}
-- Manual run
{% endif %}
----

Query in SQL Editor ({product}):

[source,SQL]
----
SELECT 1;
SELECT 2
----

Renders to:

[source,sql]
----
-- Executed by hi@modeanalytics.com
-- Query executed at 1591031089
-- Manual run
SELECT 1;
SELECT 2
----

In Postgres, we'll see two distinct statement executions.
The header appears on the first statement only.

[source,sql]
----
-- Executed by hi@modeanalytics.com
-- Query executed at 1591031089
-- Manual run
SELECT 1
----

The footers only appears on the second statement (unless per-statement footers are enabled).

[source,sql]
----
SELECT 2
-- {"user":"@jane_doe","email":"hi@modeanalytics.com","url":"https://modeanalytics.com/modeqa/reports/1820851ba5a0/runs/a85b6da6912d/queries/d7f43f015d70","scheduled":false}
----

=== Query footers

{product} always appends a non-customizable SQL comment annotation at the end of a query.
By default, this annotation is made per query.
For a multi-statement query (see example), the footer is only appended to the second statement by default.
{product} is able to enable per-statement footers if the Workspace uses multi-statement queries.

Query footers are not visible in {product}'s SQL Editor to the user while editing a query, and query footers do not display in {product}'s UI as a part of the query syntax for a past query run.
This annotation does appear as part of the syntax executed by the database.

The annotation always includes:

* user: query runner's username.
* email: email address.
* url: complete query run url.
* scheduled: true/false.

==== Examples

In {product}:

[source,SQL]
----
SELECT 1;
SELECT 2
----

In Snowflake (*two* distinct statement executions;
*without* per-statement footers, only the second statement show the footer comment):

[source,SQL]
----
SELECT 1
SELECT 2
-- {"user":"@jane_doe","email":"hi@modeanalytics.com","url":"https://modeanalytics.com/modeqa/reports/1820851ba5a0/runs/a85b6da6912d/queries/d7f43f015d70","scheduled":false}
----

In Snowflake (two distinct statement executions;
*with* per-statement footers, both statements show the footer comment):

[source,SQL]
----
SELECT 1
-- {"user":"@jane_doe","email":"hi@modeanalytics.com","url":"https://modeanalytics.com/modeqa/reports/1820851ba5a0/runs/a85b6da6912d/queries/d7f43f015d70","scheduled":false}
SELECT 2
-- {"user":"@jane_doe","email":"hi@modeanalytics.com"","url":"https://modeanalytics.com/modeqa/reports/1820851ba5a0/runs/a85b6da6912d/queries/d7f43f015d70","scheduled":false}

[#uploading-data]
=== Uploading data

IMPORTANT: **All data uploaded into the {product} Public Warehouse is publicly accessible by anyone on the internet, so take care not to upload anything sensitive or confidential.**

. Click the app switcher icon in the top navigation bar and select *{product}*.
. Locate your name in the upper left corner of the window and ensure it says *{product} Community* above your name.
(If not, click on your name, click *Switch*, scroll to the bottom of the pop-up, and click the *Switch* button under {product} Community).
. Click on your name in the upper left corner of the window and then click *Contribute Public Data*.
. Click *Choose and Upload*.
. Select a CSV (up to 500 MB) containing the data you'd like to upload.
. After the data uploads, you will have the opportunity to customize the name of the table and how the columns are stored.
When querying the table, you will be required to type the namespace first.
In the example below, the user's account name is "tutorial", so the uploaded table name will include the "tutorial" prefix:
+
[.bordered]
image::public-data-customize-columns.png[Adding Public Data]

Table names in the {product} Public Warehouse must:

* Be 4-63 characters in length.
* Start with a lowercase letter.
* End with a number or letter.
* Not contain spaces or special characters (use underscores).

Next, you'll set the column names and types.
Columns follow the same naming rules as tables.
//If you are unsure about the data type for any particular column or would like a general overview of data types, check out the link:https://mode.com/sql-tutorial/sql-data-types[SQL School lesson on data types,window=_blank].

When you are finished, *check the box* next to "I understand this table will be public to all {product} users", and then click *Finish Import* at the bottom of the Customize Columns screen.
You can now query this data in {product} by selecting {product} Public Warehouse as the database.
