:description: You can now use natural language to search for answers to your business questions.

// persona: business user

Use natural language to search for answers to your business questions. You can begin a search from the Search bar in the Home page, or by entering your question in the Search bar that appears in the top navigation bar when you navigate to a different tab.

Click the search bar labeled *Ask any business question you have*, select the Worksheet to search on, and type your question in natural language. You can change the Worksheet selected when you search from the Home page. When you search using the search bar in the top navigation bar, the search inherits the Worksheet you last searched on.

ThoughtSpot translates your question into a SQL query using a Large Language Model (LLM). When you enter your question, you will see the AI-generated Answer appear, along with a list of related Answers created by users in your team.

See xref:ai-answers-best-practices.adoc[] for more information about how to best use natural language search.

Note that you must select a Worksheet to see an AI-generated Answer. If you use natural language search when the source is set to *All sources*, you see a list of user-generated Answers that match your query the closest.

== Enable or disable AI-generated Answers on Worksheets

// Worksheets with less than 200 columns will have AI-generated Answers enabled by default, while Worksheets with more than 200 columns will be disabled by default.-- not in scope 9.2.0.cl

Users can decide to disable or enable AI-generated Answers based on the Worksheets to which they have edit access. When natural language search is enabled, AI-generated Answers are enabled for all Worksheets by default.

To disable AI-generated Answers on a Worksheet, follow these steps:

. Navigate to the *Data* tab.

. From the list of data objects, select the name of your Worksheet by scrolling or by searching the name in the search bar.

. Select the *more options* menu in the top right corner of the page. Note that if the *Edit Worksheet* and *more options* menu icon are grayed out, you do not have edit access to the Worksheet.

. From the *more options* menu, click *Disable AI generated answer*.
