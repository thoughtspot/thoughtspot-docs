:description: Learn how to work with period-to-date keywords.
:jira: SCAL-188158, SCAL-205713 (doc enhancement)

The following period *_to date_* keywords exist:

- week to date
- month to date
- quarter to date
- year to date

== Behaviors

These filters have two behaviors that depend upon how they are used in conjunction with other date keywords. These secondary keywords are considered triggers, because they trigger a change in behavior of the *_to date_* keyword.

=== For each period

When a *_to date_* keyword is used in combination with a secondary date keyword at the same grain or higher, then the behavior is modified to  a FOR EACH period.

=== Current period

If no secondary date keyword is included in the query or the secondary date keyword is at a lower grain, then a filter for the CURRENT PERIOD is applied.


|===
| |Daily|Weekly|Monthly|Quarterly|Yearly

|Week to date
|_Current period_
|_FOR EACH PERIOD_

Less than or equal to day number of week


|_FOR EACH PERIOD_

FOR EACH PERIOD

Equal to week of month

AND

Less than or equal to day number of week

|_FOR EACH PERIOD_

Equal to week of quarter

AND

Less than or equal to day number of week

|_FOR EACH PERIOD_ 

Equal to week of year


AND

Less than or equal to day number of week


|Month to date
|_Current period_
|_Current period_
|_FOR EACH PERIOD_ 

Less than or equal to day number of month

|_FOR EACH PERIOD_ 

Equal to month of quarter

AND

Less than or equal to day number of month
|_FOR EACH PERIOD_ 

Equal to month of year

|Quarter to date

=== To date filtering rules

* When acting as a filter for the CURRENT PERIOD, this behavior is similar to the behavior of the THIS PERIOD filter. However, there is a notable difference.

** THIS PERIOD is the complete period in question including any future days in the period. 
Whereas CURRENT PERIOD’s maximum boundary is less than TODAY as defined by the ThoughtSpot’s cluster timezone.

* CURRENT Period 

** For ThoughtSpot Cloud connections today are excluded from the boundary (less than today’s date).

** For ThoughtSpot’s Falcon database, today is included in the boundary (less than or equal to today’s date).

* FOR EACH includes today in the boundary (less than or equal to today’s date).

=== Grouping and filtering

In the majority of scenarios the secondary date keyword will act as a grouping column. For example: In the following search, monthly is the secondary date keyword and is acting as a grouping column.

[sales] [month to date] *[monthly]*

A secondary date keyword could also be applied as a filter. The rule that is applied is dependent upon the column of the filter. Example: January is a monthly filter, therefore the monthly FOR EACH rule is applied. 

[sales] [week to date] [‘january’] will return for all the months of January (every year of data):

* the sum of sales as a single value
* for today’s week of the month
* up to and including today’s day of the week

[sales] [month to date] [‘january’] will return for all the months of January (every year of data):

* the sum of sales as a single value
* up to and including today’s day of the month

=== Not visualized columns

Chart settings include the ability to set tokens as not visualized. A not-visualized token does not change the behavior of the query. The *_to date_* logic is defined based upon the tokens that are defined in the base query. 

== Examples

=== Current period

== Using period to date keywords with a calendar

Period-to-date keywords work slightly differently depending on whether you are using the DEFAULT calendar or a custom calendar and whether you're using ThoughtSpot's Falcon in-memory database or an external database, like a cloud data warehouse.

When you use the DEFAULT calendar, data is available up to TODAY, whereas when you use a custom calendar it is not.


|===
| |Default calendar |Custom calendar

|Falcon, date
|Includes current date
|Excludes current date

|Falcon, datetime
|Includes current date
|Excludes current date

|External database, date
|Excludes current date
|Excludes current date

|External database, datetime
|Includes current date
|Excludes current date
