ThoughtSpot uses replication of stored data. When a node fails, ThoughtSpot continues to operate.

To support high availability, your ThoughtSpot instance must have at least three nodes.
In a three or more node system, if one node fails, its services will be distributed to the other nodes.
The failover is automatic.
However, when a node fails, you should xref:support-contact.adoc[contact ThoughtSpot Support] about replacing the node when possible.

A node is considered to have failed when one or more of these conditions occur:

* Two or more disks have failed.
* SSD has failed.
* Memory failure.
* Another hardware component has failed (networking, motherboard, power supplies).

== Symptoms

You should suspect node failure if you observe these symptoms:

* Performance degrades significantly.
* You receive alert emails beginning with WARNING or CRITICAL, that describe problems with one of the nodes not running.
* A node does not come up upon booting or rebooting the system.

If you notice these symptoms, xref:support-contact.adoc[contact ThoughtSpot Support].

== Node replacement

Node replacement is done on site by ThoughtSpot Support.
You must schedule a maintenance window, since some downtime is required.
