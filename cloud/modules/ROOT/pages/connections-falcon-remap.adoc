Modify the connection parameters by editing the source mapping `yaml` file that was created when you added the connection.
For example, you can remap the existing table or column to a different table or column in an existing database connection.
ThoughtSpot recommends that you check the dependencies before and after you remap a table or column in a connection to ensure they display as intended.

To remap a {connection} connection:

ifndef::spotter[]
. Select *Data* in the top navigation bar.
. Open the *Connections* tab in the left navigation bar.
endif::[]
ifdef::spotter[]
. Click the app switcher menu image:spotter-app-switcher.png[Spotter app switcher] and then click *{form-factor}*.
. On the left side of the screen, select *Manage data > Manage data sources*.
. On the _Data workspace_ page, click *Connections*.
endif::[]
. Select the name of the connection you want to remap.
. Click the *More* icon image:icon-more-10px.png[more options menu icon] and select *Remapping* on the upper-right side of the page.

. Select *Download* to download the source mapping file.


. Edit the file, as required, and save it.
// [Edit the yaml file]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/trino-yaml.png "Edit the yaml file")
. On the Remapping page, select *Browse your files*, and upload your edited mapping file to update the mapping of your connection.

To remove a table from a connection, delete it from the connection details page.
