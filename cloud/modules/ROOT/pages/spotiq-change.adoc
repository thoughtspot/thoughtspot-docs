With SpotIQ change analysis, you can compare any two data points in a visualization for change and identify key change drivers from the underlying attribute columns.


SpotIQ change analysis compares data points of simple or complex measures using these aggregates:

* _Sum_
* _Count_
* _Sum over sum_, which generates a Liveboard that has 'what-if' percentage insights
* _Average_, which generates a Liveboard that has 'what-if' percentage insights
* Other functions which use a 'versus' analysis to show the absolute change grouped by different drill attributes

1.&nbsp;Give feedback:: SpotIQ learns how to improve its analysis based on the information you provide. If you dislike a specific type of insight, SpotIQ pushes that type of insight to the bottom of any future SpotIQ analyses you run. The feedback you provide is specific to you and does not affect the SpotIQ experience of other users.
2.&nbsp;Add to a Liveboard:: You can add the specific visualization to an existing Liveboard, or create a new Liveboard and add it there.
3.&nbsp;Analysis details:: Get the name of the algorithm.
4.&nbsp;More options:: You can run another round of SpotIQ analysis, download the data as a CSV file, edit this visualization, or edit a copy of the visualization.

[#advanced-change-analysis]
== Advanced change analysis in SpotIQ

ThoughtSpot ships with a number of comparative algorithms.
Using the *Advanced* option of SpotIQ, you can adjust the parameters of the analysis, or choose a different comparative algorithm for your data.

After selecting the relevant analysis columns, select *Customize parameters*.
