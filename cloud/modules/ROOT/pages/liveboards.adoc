Liveboards are the ThoughtSpot term for a dashboard. They group and manage related search result visuals.

== Liveboards

*_Liveboards_* act like live dashboards.
They are collections of your related Answers, in the form of charts and tables, and your headline metrics.

You can pin charts, tables, and headlines to any Liveboard which you created, and those that have been shared with you with the *Edit* privilege.
When you create a Liveboard, you can share it with other people with either the *View* or *Edit* privilege.
Liveboards are interactive, allowing you to perform actions like xref:search-drill-down.adoc[drilling down] on Answers, xref:liveboard-filters.adoc[filtering], excluding values, and xref:answer-explorer.adoc[exploring] Answers or headlines.

=== Sample Liveboard

This is an example of a Liveboard you might create or view, as a member of a retailer's *Sales* department:

image::business-user-sample-pinboard-new-experience.png[Sample Liveboard]

Notice that you can explore any visualization, follow any KPI, or perform a number of other actions using the *more options menu* in the upper-right corner of a visualization image:icon-more-10px.png[More menu icon].

=== Using filters

You can filter a Liveboard to only see the relevant data.

To filter a Liveboard, follow these steps:

. Select the *Edit* button at the upper right of the Liveboard. If this button is grayed out, you do not have edit privileges for the Liveboard. To resolve this, contact your administrator or the creator of the Liveboard.
. In the top menu bar, select *Add filters*.
Note that you need access to the underlying data source to be able to filter a Liveboard.

. In the columns list, select the *Add filter* icon next to the column you would like to filter on.

. Under *Default values > Include*, select the values to include in your Answer.

. If you want to exclude values, select *Exclude* and choose values to exclude.

. Select *Apply*.

See xref:liveboard-filters.adoc[Liveboard filters] for more information.

=== Getting to insights

You can leverage Liveboards to gain insights into your data in several ways.
xref:answer-explorer.adoc[Answer Explorer], ThoughtSpot's AI-guided exploration of Answers and headline metrics within Liveboards, provides you with valuable suggestions on how to explore and understand your data.
The feature suggests ways to answer questions that are relevant to many other users, and it takes into account your own ThoughtSpot history.
Use Answer Explorer to filter an Answer or headline, run comparisons, replace items in an Answer, or add additional elements to an Answer.

Liveboards always have the most current data.
If you *follow* a Liveboard or a KPI, you can schedule regular updates on that Liveboard or pinned headline, and track its changes.

You can also *drill down* on any Answer in a Liveboard.
See <<drill,Drilling down>>.

[#drill]
=== Drilling down

When you drill down, you can see more information about the data within your search.
You can drill down into a datapoint to get a finer grained view of that datapoint and the data behind it.
Move easily from a general view of your information to a more specific representation of the data behind a datapoint at a click.
For example, in a *revenue by department* search, you may notice that your *clothing* department has the highest revenue.
You can drill down on *clothing* by *product name* to find out which products contribute to those high sales.
There is no limit to how deep you can drill down.

You can drill down from within the *Answer Explorer* view in a Liveboard.
This allows you to use the back button to go back one step at a time, and to see the Answer fill your screen.

=== Presenting

Use the *Present* feature to present a Liveboard as a live slideshow with the latest data.
You can answer questions instantly during your presentation by editing an Answer, drilling down, filtering a visualization, or using Answer Explorer.

To present a Liveboard, click the *More* icon image:icon-more-10px.png[More menu icon] at the upper-right corner of the Liveboard, and select *Present*.

[#edit-mode]
=== Edit a Liveboard
If you are using the xref:liveboard-experience-new.adoc[new Liveboard experience], you must enter *Edit mode* to make changes to the Liveboard. This includes adding filters, adding tabs, and changing the layout. You do not need to enter edit mode to change the name of the Liveboard or Liveboard visualizations.

To enter edit mode, select the *Edit* button at the upper right of the Liveboard. If this button is grayed out, you do not have edit privileges for the Liveboard. To resolve this, contact your administrator or the creator of the Liveboard.

[#liveboard-tabs]
=== Liveboard tabs

include::partial$liveboard-tabs-intro.adoc[]

To learn more about liveboard tabs, refer to xref:liveboard-tabs.adoc[Liveboard tabs].

[#back-button]
=== Undo, redo, and reset buttons
As you work with Liveboard visualizations, you may want to undo or redo an action. Use the in-product undo, redo, and reset buttons to reset or go back or forward 1 step each time you make a change in a search, saved Answer, or Liveboard visualization (for example, when you drill down, or sort). These buttons appear to the left of the *Explore* button in a Liveboard visualization. Note that the reset button is only available for saved Answers and visualizations; it resets the Answer to its last saved state.

=== Downloading

You can download a Liveboard as a PDF, or as a xref:scriptability.adoc[scriptable TML file] for migration to another environment.

To download a Liveboard, click the *More* icon image:icon-more-10px.png[More menu icon] at the upper-right corner of the Liveboard, and select *Download as PDF*.
You can download the whole Liveboard, or just certain visualizations.

To export a TML file, select the *More* icon image:icon-more-10px.png[More menu icon] at the upper-right corner of the Liveboard, and select *Export TML*.
You can export Liveboard and the underlying data source, or Worksheet, or just the Liveboard.

NOTE: If you do not see the option to download the Liveboard as a PDF, your company may have removed the Liveboard download option.
If you would like to download Liveboards, contact your ThoughtSpot administrator.

=== Sharing Liveboards and Answers

You can share Liveboards and Answers with other ThoughtSpot users and groups, and send them a notification email.

[#answer]
== Answers

Answers are saved search results.
When you search on your data, your results appear in the form of a table or chart, depending on your search.
There are many different types of charts.
ThoughtSpot picks the chart type that best fits your search, but you can choose another chart type if you like.
When you're done customizing a search result, you can save it as an Answer, and pin it to a Liveboard.
The Answer always contains the latest data.

You can easily change a saved or pinned *_Answer_* by customizing it to suit your needs.

=== Change Visualizations

* *Change between table and chart* representation by toggling between the table image:data-table-icon.png[table] and chart image:chart-generic-icon.png[chart] elements.
