When you perform a search or view and edit an Answer, you can rename the axes on your chart or the columns on your table.
To rename columns in an underlying Worksheet, so that these names persist for any user searching on a Worksheet, see xref:worksheets.adoc[create and use Worksheets].

== Rename a chart axis

You can always rename a chart axis for clarity, brevity, format, and so on.

In the following example, it makes sense to rename the axis created from grouping as _Item Price & Item Cost_ to something shorter, like _Item Price and Cost_.

To rename an axis, follow these steps.

. While viewing your Answer as a chart, open the dropdown menu icon image:icon-caret-right-20px.png[dropdown icon image] next to the axis label you want to rename.
. Select *Rename*.

. Type the new name in the text box that appears, and either click out or select *Enter/Return* on your keyboard.

Alternatively, you can select the chart configuration icon image:icon-gear-10px.png[chart configuration icon], select the tile for the axis name, enter the new name in the text box, and click *Enter*.

== Rename a column in a chart

You can rename a column in a chart in a similar way.

To rename a column, follow these steps.

. Type the new name in the text box that appears, and either click out or select *Enter/Return* on your keyboard. The new name will be reflected in the table header, tooltips, legend, and chart configuration menu. Changes made to a table are not reflected in the underlying Worksheet.

Alternatively, you can select the chart configuration icon image:icon-gear-10px.png[chart configuration icon], select the tile for the column name, enter the new name in the text box, and click *Enter*.
