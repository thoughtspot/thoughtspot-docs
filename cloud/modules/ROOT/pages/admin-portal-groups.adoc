Manage user groups in ThoughtSpot.

Before people can sign in and use ThoughtSpot, you need to create a username, a password, and a membership in one or more groups for them.
Use the Admin Console to easily create and manage your user groups.

[NOTE]
====
This article contains instructions for managing groups in a single tenant environment. If you do not have an Org switcher between the help icon and the *Search answers and Liveboards* search box, your company is in a single tenant environment.

If your company uses the xref:orgs-overview.adoc[Orgs] feature for multi-tenancy in ThoughtSpot, you can see an Org switcher to the left of the help icon in the top navigation bar. Refer to xref:admin-portal-groups-orgs.adoc[].
====

Refer to xref:groups-privileges.adoc[Understand groups and privileges] to learn about the privileges you can assign to a user or group.

To manage groups, navigate to the Admin Console by selecting the *Admin* tab from the top navigation bar.
Select *Groups* from the side navigation bar that appears.

* *Create a group* by selecting the *+ Add Group* button
* *Manage an existing group* by selecting the group you would like to edit: add an existing group to the group, add a user to the group, modify the group's privileges, or resend or test the welcome email
* *Delete a group* by hovering over a group name, clicking the checkbox that appears, and selecting the *Delete* button
