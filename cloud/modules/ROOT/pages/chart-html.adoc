:description: You can use HTML 5 in titles and descriptions for Liveboards, Answers, and visualizations within Liveboards.

You can use HTML 5 in titles and descriptions for Liveboards, Answers, and visualizations within Liveboards. You can also use HTML 5 in Liveboard tab names. For example, you can add a clickable link to a word or phrase in a description, or italicize part of an Answer title. If you are using the xref:liveboard-experience-new.adoc[new Liveboard experience], you can also use HTML 5 in Liveboard titles and descriptions.

ThoughtSpot supports all HTML 5 tags in Liveboard, Answer, and visualization titles and descriptions, and in Liveboard tab names. For a full list of HTML 5 tags, refer to https://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp[this HTML reference^], or any reference of your choice. Note that ThoughtSpot only supports HTML 5. ThoughtSpot does not support tags that no longer exist in HTML 5, such as
`<acronym>`.

This feature is only available if you are using the xref:answer-experience-new.adoc[new Answer experience], which is on by default. By default, this feature is only available for Answers and for visualizations within Liveboards. To use HTML 5 in Liveboard titles and descriptions and Liveboard tab names, you must use the xref:liveboard-experience-new.adoc[new Liveboard experience].

== Add links to titles and descriptions

Links in your Liveboard, Answer, or visualization titles or descriptions or Liveboard tab names enable you to quickly navigate to another website, to do research or take action based on the data you saw in ThoughtSpot's charts and tables. For example, a retail store may track its highest-selling products on a specific chart. You could add a link to the store's orders website, so viewers of the chart can quickly order more products.

To add links to your titles and descriptions, follow these steps:

. Open an Answer or Liveboard you have *edit* privileges for, or create a new Answer or Liveboard.

. Select the title or description text box. For Liveboards, you must enter *Edit* mode, then select the title, description, or tab name text box.

. Type your title or description, and include an HTML link. For example:
+
----
Order more of the highest-selling products at our <a href="https://your-website-domain.com">orders website</a>.
----
+

== Limitations
In the current release, there are certain limitations to the HTML customizations you can make to titles and descriptions:

* You can use a title, description, or tab name HTML link if you have *view-only* privileges on an Answer. When you have *edit* privileges, the link works for visualizations in Liveboards, but not for Answers.

* This feature is only available for Liveboard titles, descriptions, and tab names if you use the xref:liveboard-experience-new.adoc[new Liveboard experience], which is on by default.

* This feature is only available if you are using the xref:answer-experience-new.adoc[new Answer experience], which is on by default.
