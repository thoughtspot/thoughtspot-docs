:description: ThoughtSpot has intuitive user group management for assigning privileges, user selection, multi-tier subgroups, and emailing.


Before adding users, create the groups to which they belong.
Each group includes a set of privileges for its users.

[NOTE]
====
This article contains instructions for managing groups in a single tenant environment. If you do not have an Org switcher between the help icon and the *Search answers and Liveboards* search box, your company is in a single tenant environment.

If your company uses the xref:orgs-overview.adoc[Orgs] feature for multi-tenancy in ThoughtSpot, you can see an Org switcher to the left of the help icon in the top navigation bar. Refer to xref:group-management-orgs.adoc[].

[#add-group]

image::add-group.png[Enter details for the new group]
+
[#group-name]
Group name::
Enter a unique name for the group.
+
[#display-name]
Display name::
Name of the group as it appears in ThoughtSpot.
+
[#sharing-visibility]
Sharing visibility::
Indicate whether objects can be shared with this group. When set to *SHAREABLE*,
this group is an option in the *Share* dialog.
+
[#description]
Description::
Optionally, enter a description.
+
[#privileges]
Privileges::
Check the xref:groups-privileges.adoc#list-of-privileges[privileges] you want to grant to the group. If you add the privilege *Has administration privileges* to a group, all users in that group can see all the data in ThoughtSpot. Administrators can always see all data sources, and xref:security-rls.adoc[row-level security] does not apply to them.
[NOTE]
Privileges are not available on clusters with RBAC enabled.
[#roles]
Roles::
Check the xref:groups-privileges.adoc#list-of-privileges[roles] you want to assign to the group. If you add the role *Super Admin* to a group, all users in that group can see all the data in ThoughtSpot. Super Admins see all data sources, and xref:security-rls.adoc[row-level security] does not apply to them.
[NOTE]
Roles are only available on clusters with RBAC enabled. RBAC is disabled by default. To enable this feature, contact ThoughtSpot Support.

When editing a group, keep in mind that only subgroups or possible subgroups appear in the list of groups.
The *No Groups in Group* only indicates there are no children in this group's hierarchy.

. Select the groups you want to add in the list by clicking the box next to the group name.
. You can also use *Search* to find groups by name.

=== Users

Follow these steps to change the users of the group:

. Deselect the users you want to remove from the list by clearing the box next to the user name.
. Select *Update* to save changes.

[#change-email]
=== Email

You can configure groups so that users receive a _welcome email_ that introduces them to ThoughtSpot, and initiates the onboarding process.

Follow these steps to configure group-wide emails:

. Select the *Email* tab.
. Under *Resend welcome email*, select either either _All users_ or _New users_.
. Enter optional text for the email.
. To send the email immediately, select *Send*.
