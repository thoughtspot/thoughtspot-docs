:description: ThoughtSpot has intuitive and powerful user group management for assigning privileges, user selection, multi-tier subgroups, and emailing.



Before adding users, create the groups to which they belong.
Each group includes a set of privileges for its users.

[#add-group]
== Create a group

To create a group and add privileges for the group, follow these steps:

. Navigate to the Admin Console by clicking on the *Admin* tab from the top navigation bar.
. Select *Groups* from the side navigation bar that appears.

+
image::add-group.png[Enter details for the new group]
+
[#group-name]
Group name::
Enter a unique name for the group.
+
[#display-name]
Display name::
Name of the group as it appears in ThoughtSpot.
+
[#sharing-visibility]
Sharing visibility::
Indicate whether objects can be shared with this group. When set to *SHARABLE*,
this group is an option in the *Share* dialog.
+
[#description]
Description::
Optionally, enter a description.
+
[#privileges]
Privileges::
Check the xref:groups-privileges.adoc#list-of-privileges[privileges] you want to grant to the group. If you add the privilege *Has administration privileges* to a group, all users in that group can see all the data in ThoughtSpot. Administrators can always see all data sources, and xref:security-rls.adoc[Row level security] does not apply to them.

. You can also add _<<add-groups,Groups>>_ (these would be the subgroups of the group you are editing), _<<add-users,Users>>_.
. Click *Add* to create the group.

[#add-groups]
=== Groups

Follow these steps to assign subgroups to the group:

. Click the *Groups* tab.
. Select the groups you want to add in the list by clicking the box next to the group name.
. You can also use *Search* to find groups by name.

[#edit-group]
== Edit a group

. Find the group you want to edit in the list, and click its name.

If you don't immediately see the name of the group, try searching for it.

. You can change the _<<group-name,Group name>>_, _<<display-name,Display name>>_, _<<sharing-visibility,Sharing visibility>>_, _<<description,Description>>_, and the selected _<<privileges,Privileges>>_.
+
You can also make changes to the _<<change-groups,Groups>>_ (these would be the subgroups of the group you are editing), _<<change-users,Users>>_, or _<<change-email,Email>>_.

. Make your changes, and click *Update*.

[#change-groups]
=== Groups

When editing a group, keep in mind that only subgroups or possible subgroups appear in the list of groups.
The *No Groups in Group* only indicates there are no children in this group's hierarchy.
Do not underestimate the importance of the parent(s) of the group, because each group inherits the privileges of each of its parent groups.

Follow these steps to change subgroups of the group:

. Click the *Groups* tab.
. Select the groups you want to add in the list by clicking the box next to the group name.
. You can also use *Search* to find groups by name.
. Deselect the groups you want to remove from the list by clearing the box next to the group name.
. Click *Update* to save changes.

[#change-users]
=== Users

Follow these steps to change the users of the group:

. Click the *Users* tab.
. Select the users you want to add in the list by clicking the box next to the user name.
. You can also use *Search* to find users by name.
. Deselect the users you want to remove from the list by clearing the box next to the user name.
. Click *Update* to save changes.

[#change-email]
=== Email

You can configure groups so that users receive a _welcome email_ that introduces them to ThoughtSpot, and initiates the onboarding process.

Follow these steps to configure group-wide emails:

. Click the *Email* tab.
. Under *Resend welcome email*, select either either _All users_ or _New users_.
. Enter optional text for the email.
Here, we added "Welcome!"
. To send the email immediately, click *Send*.
. To test the email, click "Test welcome email"
. Click *Update* to save changes.
