You can now customize tooltips to make charts easier to read. Use customized tooltips to add measures, attributes, and formulas that are not visualized in the chart. You can also customize tooltips to remove certain fields from the tooltips in a complex chart so that users are not overwhelmed with irrelevant information.

To customize tooltip settings complete the following steps:

. Select the *Edit chart configuration* icon image:icon-gear-10px.png[chart customization icon].
. Click *Settings*.
. Under *Tooltip* click the *Edit tooltip* button.

By default, fields visualized in charts are included in the tooltip.
. Add or remove a column by toggling it on or off.
. Drag and drop columns to rearrange.
