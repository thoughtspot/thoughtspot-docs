:description: Learn how to configure OAuth for a Dremio connection in ThoughtSpot.

ThoughtSpot supports OAuth for a {connection} connection.

To configure OAuth for {connection}, you create an app in the Identity Provider and use the app’s credentials to register it in {connection} as an external token provider. Once these steps are completed, {connection} will allow connections coming in with the JWT issued by the IdP.

[#part-1]
== Part 1: Configuring the IdP with Okta

The following steps detail the configuration of IdP with Okta as an example. You can set up any other OpenID Connect (OIDC)-based IdP providers following a similar process. For details, refer to the respective documentation for those.

To configure the IdP with Okta, do the following:

. Sign in to the Okta console with a user having administrator privileges. Navigate to the *Applications* page in the console and select *Create App Integration*.

+
. For sign-in method, choose *OIDC - OpenID Connect*.
. For application type, choose *Web Application*
. Select *Next*.
. Under Grant type, make sure *Authorization Code* is selected.
+

. For Sign-in redirect URIs, add the ThoughtSpot redirect URI for the application.
+
It should follow this format:
+
`\https://<your-thoughtspot-instance-host>/callosum/v1/connection/generateTokens`
+

. Assign the application to everyone in the organization or to specific groups. This step may vary for other IdPs.
+

. Collect the client credentials from the application home page and make a note of them. These will be required later for adding the external token provider in {connection}.
+

. Go to menu:Security[API], and make a note of the value for Audience. This is required in a later step
for configuring the OpenID well-known URI for the authorization server.

+
For Okta, it should follow this format:
+
`\https://<organization>.okta..com/oauth2/<unique_id>/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`
. Open the URL in a browser and make a note of the values for the following parameters:
- Issuer
- Authorization endpoint
- JWKS URI
- Token endpoint

== Part 2: Adding external token provider in {connection}

To add an external token provider in {connection}, do the following:

. Sign in to the {connection} cloud console and navigate to Organization Settings.
. From the menu, select *External Token Providers*.
. Select *Add Provider* and fill in the details of your IdP.
+

+
For User Claim Mapping, use the value of the claim in the JWT issued by the IdP that contains the value of the username in {connection}.
+
Example token generated by Okta:

== Part 3: JDBC Connection URL

Connection string for JDBC should include the token string for password parameter with username left empty.

Example connection string:
[source]
----
"jdbc:dremio:direct=sql.dremio.cloud:443;ssl=true;PROJECT_ID=732b5f6d-d2f6-4d3d-b3b6-0dc68bc778f5;token_type=jwt;password=<access_token_from_IdP>;username=;";
----

== Logging in to a connection created by another user using OAuth

As an admin user, you may run into an issue logging in to connections created using OAuth. To resolve this issue, complete the following steps:

. Search on a table belonging to the connection you are trying to edit. The following error appears:
+
image:oauth-error.png[Error reading “Error in loading data. Connection to Snowflake could not be established. OAuth login required. Login”]

. Click *Login*. You will be directed to the IDP login page.

. Enter your login credentials.

. You will now have access to edit the connection.
