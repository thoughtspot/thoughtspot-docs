:description: Learn how to create a bulk filter.

You can create a bulk filter on a saved search.
You create the filter by pasting a list of values, separated by commas, semicolons, new lines, or tabs, into the bulk filter box.
A filter allows you to easily search a large list of values repeatedly.

Your filter can have up to 10k values in it.
When you add a filter, the system does not check that the value exists in the data.
This allows you to anticipate values that _may be_ added in your filter.

Before you can create a bulk filter, you must have *Can edit* permission on the table or worksheet.
In this example, you will cut and paste values to create a bulk filter.
You could also get a list of text values from another application such as an email or cells from an Excel or Google Sheets spreadsheet.

. In table view, select multiple cells by clicking and dragging.
. Right-click and choose *Copy to clipboard*.
