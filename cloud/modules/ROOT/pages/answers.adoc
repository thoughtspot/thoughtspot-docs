:description: Answers are the saved results of a search.

You can save the results of any search and share these with other people.
Your saved searches appear on the *Answers* page.
From this page, you can see answers you saved and answers other people have saved, provided these people shared them with you or a group you belong to.

== Apply a tag

Only administrators create tags, but anyone with edit privileges can tag an object.
To add a tag to an answer:

. Find the item(s) you want to tag in the list.
. Check the box next to its name.
. Click the apply tag icon and choose one from the list.

You can apply as many tags as you like to an object.

== Make a copy of an answer

You can create a copy of an answer if you would like to make edits without changing the original answer.
When saving, you can type in a different name for your copy.

. Click *Answers*, on the top navigation bar.
. On the answer list page, click the answer you would like to edit a copy of.
. Click the More icon image:icon-more-10px.png[more options menu icon] and select *Make a copy*.

ThoughtSpot takes you to a copy of the answer, with "`Copy of`" added to the beginning of the title.

. Make any changes you want to the answer.
. Click the More icon image:icon-more-10px.png[more options menu icon] and select *Save*.

The Save Answer dialog box appears.

. Change the name and description, as needed, and click *Save*.

When you navigate back to the Answers page, your edited answer appears in the list.

== Other features

You can view other answer actions by selecting the *More* menu icon image:icon-more-10px.png[more options menu icon] at the upper right corner of the answer.

For example, you can xref:views.adoc[create a view] to use the answer as a data source, download the answer, or export an answer as a xref:tml.adoc[TML], or ThoughtSpot Modeling Language, file, optionally modify it, and xref:scriptability.adoc[migrate it to another cluster], or re-upload it to the same cluster.
