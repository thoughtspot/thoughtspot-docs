:description: Answers are the saved results of a search.

You can save the results of any search and share these with other people.
Your saved searches appear on the *Answers* page.
From this page, you can see answers you saved and answers other people have saved, provided these people shared them with you or a group you belong to.

== Apply a tag

Only administrators create tags, but anyone with edit privileges can tag an object.
To add a tag to an answer:

. Find the item(s) you want to tag in the list.
. Check the box next to its name.
. Click the apply tag icon and choose one from the list.

You can apply as many tags as you like to an object.

. Click *Answers*, on the top navigation bar.
. On the answer list page, click the answer you would like to edit a copy of.
. Click the More icon image:icon-more-10px.png[more options menu icon] and select *Copy and edit*.
