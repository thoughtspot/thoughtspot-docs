[#create_an_anomaly_alert]


Using anomaly alerts, you can receive alerts when data of KPIs you are subscribed to fall outside the predicted value range. When creating an alert, you can specify the time and frequency at which ThoughtSpot checks the KPIâ€™s data against the values predicted by ML models trained on the data.

For example, you can create an alert for a `sales weekly` KPI, and specify that ThoughtSpot monitor the values every Monday at 5 PM. You may also add individual subscribers to the alert. If the KPI's data falls outside the predicted range, ThoughtSpot sends an alert to your email and, if applicable, your subscribers' emails.

Note that ThoughtSpot checks your KPI data against the expected data range at the time period you define. If your KPI data temporarily exceeds the expected range, but does not satisfy the condition at the time the condition is next checked, you will not receive an alert notification.


NOTE: You can create alerts directly from watchlist KPIs on the home page.


To create an anomaly alert, follow these steps:

. Select the KPI you want to monitor, either by accessing a Liveboard, or by searching within the **Answers** tab. +
Optionally, create a KPI and save it as an Answer, then select **Create alert** from the **more options** menu. Note that you must save the Answer before creating an alert.
. If in a Liveboard, hover over the KPI visualization and select the **Monitor** icon. +

. The pop-up **Select an alert type** window appears.

. Select *Unexpected changes in KPI*. Click *Next*.

. [Optional] Edit the Alert name.

. Below the *Alert name* text box, ThoughtSpot displays the cadence at which it will check the KPI against the expected data range. To change this cadence, select *Change* and choose from the following options:

.. If **Hourly**, enter an hour interval to receive an alert notification ** Every _n_ hours**.
.. If **Daily**, select a time of day to receive an alert notification. ThoughtSpot displays the time zone in which your cluster deploys. [Optional] Choose whether to receive an alert notification on weekends.
.. If **Weekly**, choose a minimum of one weekday to receive an alert notification. Select a time of day to receive an alert notification.
.. If **Monthly**, choose a minimum of one date to receive an alert notification. +
Enter the date as a numerical value or a comma-separated list (for example, "5, 10, 15" to receive an alert on the fifth, tenth and fifteenth of each month). Select a time of day to receive an alert notification.
. Your name automatically appears under **Subscribers**. Enter the names of one or more teammates to subscribe them to your KPI alert schedule.
+
NOTE: You must have _view_ access to the data source underlying the KPI to schedule notifications for teammates who also have _view_ access to the data source. You must have _edit_ access to the data source underlying the KPI to schedule notifications for teammates regardless of whether they have access to the data source.

. [Optional] Select the checkbox next to *Add custom message* and type your custom message in the text box.

. Select *Create alert*.

. The *Add view access* window appears. If you have added subscribers to your KPI alert that do not have view access to the underlying data source, you can remove them from your KPI alert or give them view access here.
+
NOTE: Row-level security applies to your KPI alert subscriptions. For example, if you create a threshold-based alert for a KPI on `Sales` in all regions, you receive a notification when total sales reaches your defined threshold. Another user subscribed to your alert whose access is limited to the "West" region would receive an alert _only_ when sales in the "West" region reached the threshold defined in your alert.
