You can download a Liveboard in PDF format, without downloading each visualization separately.
Follow these steps:

. Select *Liveboards* on the top navigation bar.
. Select a Liveboard from the list of Liveboards by clicking on its title.
. In the open Liveboard, select the *More* menu image:icon-more-10px.png[more options menu icon], and select *Download PDF*.
. In the *Download* window, you have two main _Format_ output options:
 ** Select *<<pdf-pinboard,Liveboard>>* to generate a PDF that combines several visual Answers on the same page, just like they appear on the Liveboard.
 ** Select  *<<pdf-visualizations,Visualizations>>* to print each visualization on its own page of the PDF file.

NOTE: If you do not see the option to download the Liveboard as a PDF, your company may have removed the Liveboard download option. In that case, contact your ThoughtSpot administrator if you would like to download Liveboards.

[#pdf-pinboard]
== Download PDF in Liveboard format

The Liveboard format produces a PDF file that looks very similar to the Liveboard inside ThoughtSpot.
The highlights and insights appear at the top, and the rest of the Liveboard is on a rectangular grid, with natural page breaks.

Follow these steps to specify additional options:

. Under *Format*, select *Liveboard*.
. Under *Layout*, select either the _Landscape_ or _Portrait_ page orientation.
. If the Liveboard has multiple tabs, you see the *Select tabs to download* option. Select the specific tabs you would like to download, or select *All* to download all tabs. By default, ThoughtSpot includes all tabs in the PDF.
. Select *Download*.

[#pdf-visualizations]
== Download PDF in Visualizations format

When you select *Visualizations*, you can choose to print all, or some, of the visualizations in the Liveboard.
The highlights and insights appear at the top, and the rest of the visualizations get their own page.

Follow these steps to specify additional options:

. Under *Format*, select *Visualizations*.
. Under *Layout*, select either the _Landscape_ or _Portrait_ page orientation.
. Under *Content*, specify if you want the table visuals to end after filling the whole page by selecting the _Truncate Tables_ option.
+
NOTE: If you choose not to truncate tables, the page number and footer will appear only on the last page of the table. Note that page length of a non-truncated table will still count towards total page length of the pdf.
. Under *Visualizations*, select the visualizations you want in the PDF.
Deselect any visualizations you do not want. If your Liveboard has tabs, you can also select or deselect tabs to include in the PDF.
. Select *Download*.

[#pdf-width]
== Change PDF width

By default, Liveboard PDFs download at a width of 1920 pixels, which supports most Liveboard visualizations and layouts. To change this default width to a different width in pixels for your company, contact {support-url}. For example, if most users in your company view ThoughtSpot in full screen, request that ThoughtSpot set the Liveboard PDF width to the full screen width.

[#pdf-examine]
== Examine the PDF

After the download completes, examine your PDF.

Notice that the PDF produced in *Liveboard* mode combines the visuals on the page in the same manner as the original Liveboard.
Contrast this with the PDF produced in *Visualizations* mode: this PDF combines the small adjacent indicator and KPI visuals at the top, and all other visuals and tables appear on their own page.
