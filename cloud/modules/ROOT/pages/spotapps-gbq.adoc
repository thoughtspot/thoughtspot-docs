include::partial$spotapp-prereqs-general.adoc[]

* Administrator access to {application} on console.cloud.google.com for the project
* Administrator access to IAM, to create roles and Service accounts
* Access to the following {application} tables and worksheets in your cloud data warehouse. Refer to <<schema,{spotapp} schema>> for more details.
** JOBS_BY_PROJECT (table)
** GBQ : JOB TIMELINE BY PROJECT (worksheet)
* Run the required SQL commands in your cloud data warehouse. Refer to <<sql,Run SQL commands>>.
