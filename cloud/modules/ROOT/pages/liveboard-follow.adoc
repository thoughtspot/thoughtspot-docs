:description: In ThoughtSpot, you can follow Liveboards and schedule email notifications to regularly review the visuals that represent dynamic data.

include::partial$liveboards-announcement.adoc[]

NOTE: This feature is now deprecated.
You may not use it starting with the January Cloud release.
Instead, create a Liveboard schedule.
A Liveboard schedule emails a PDF of the Liveboard to you on a regular schedule.
Your existing Liveboard follows will be migrated to Liveboard schedules.
For details, see xref:deprecation.adoc[Deprecation Announcements].

When you follow a Liveboard, ThoughtSpot sends you regular emails that contain the snapshot of the Liveboard.
You can change the scheduling of this email to suit your business needs.
