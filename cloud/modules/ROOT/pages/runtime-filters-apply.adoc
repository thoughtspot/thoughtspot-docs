Learn how to apply a runtime filter.

Runtime filters allow you to apply filters to the data returned by the APIs or the visualization or Liveboard you're embedding.
Before you apply a filter, make sure you xref:runtime-filters.adoc#limitations-of-runtime-filters[understand their limitations].

The filters are specified in the request URL as parameters.
Before you can use runtime filter(s), you need to do these procedures:

. Embed a https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/?pageid=embed-a-viz[visualization] and https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/?pageid=embed-pinboard[Liveboard] using the Visual Embed SDK and authenticate to ThoughtSpot.
. Use the xref:rest-api.adoc[Data API] to https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/?pageid=embed-data-restapi[retrieve a search answer or Liveboard].

To add a runtime filter to your API call or the  embedded object:

. Construct the URL for embedding the visualization or making a REST API call.
. Paste the URL into a text editor.
. Append the runtime filter to the URL, using the xref:runtime-filters-operators.adoc[runtime filter operators].
The format for the runtime filter is:
 ** For Embedding a Liveboard:
+
----
http://<thoughtspot_server>:<port>/
?col1=<column_name\>&op1=<operator\>&val1=<value\>
#/pinboard/<pinboard_id>
----

 ** For Embedding a visualization:
+
----
http://<thoughtspot_server>:<port>/
?col1=<column_name\>&op1=<operator\>&val1=<value\>
#/pinboard/<pinboard_id>/<visualization_id>
----

 ** For the REST API with a Liveboard:
+
----
http://<thoughtspot_server>:<port>
/callosum/v1/tspublic/v1/pinboarddata
?id=<pinboard_id>
&col1=<column_name\>&op1=<operator\>&val1=<value\>
----

 ** For the REST API with a visualization:
+
----
http://<thoughtspot_server>:<port>
/callosum/v1/tspublic/v1/pinboarddata
?id=<pinboard_id>&vizid=%5B<visualization_id>%5D
&col1=<column_name\>&op1=<operator\>&val1=<value\>
----
. To add additional filters on a particular column, you can specify multiple values by separating them with `&` (ampersand) as in the example:
+
----
 val1=foo&val1=bar
----
+
You can also use the `IN` operator for multiple values, as shown in this example:
+
----
 col1=<column_name>&op1=IN&val1=<value>&val1=<value>
----

. Add additional filters by incrementing the number at the end of each parameter in the *Runtime Filter* for each filter you want to add, for example, `col2`, `op2`, `val2` and so on.

This example passes multiple variables to a single column as well as multiple columns.
It shows that data values are returned as epoch.

----
  col1=region&op1=IN&val1=midwest&val1=south&val1=northeast
  &col2=date&op2=BET&val2=<epoch_start>&val2=<epoch_end>
----
