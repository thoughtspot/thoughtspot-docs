== Validate metadata

You can now validate connections to discover any changes in metadata after the connection was created. When you validate a connection, ThoughtSpot provides a JSON file containing details on any metadata changes. Once alerted to a metadata change, you can use TML to update the connection.

To validate your connection:

. Select *Data* in the top navigation bar.

. Open the *Connections* tab in the left navigation bar.

. Select the name of the connection you want to validate.

. Select the *more options* menu icon image:icon-more-10px.png[ellipsis icon] and click *Validate*.

. If ThoughtSpot detects any changes to the connection's metadata, the following message appears: "Your connection is not valid and requires metadata changes. You can download the list of changes affecting this connection by clicking on the button below."
+
To download the change log, click *Download metadata change log*. The change log automatically downloads to your browser's Downloads folder in JSON format.

To remove a table from a connection, delete it from the connection details page.
