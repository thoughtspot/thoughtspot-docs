:description: Rebrand your embedded ThoughtSpot content to match the look and feel of your host application and customize system-generated links and notifications.



You can customize and rebrand the look and feel of the ThoughtSpot UI elements to match your companyâ€™s branding guidelines.

You can also customize the format of the system-generated links and notifications.

== Style customization

You can modify the following UI components by using the *Customization* > *Styles* menu in the *Develop* tab:

* Application logo & favicon
* Font style for charts and tables
* Background color of the application
* Background color of the navigation panel
* Color palette for charts
* Footer text
* Page title

For more information about rebranding the look and feel of the embedded ThoughtSpot UI, see https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/?pageid=customize-style[Customize layout and styles].

== Customize the format of system-generated links

ThoughtSpot sends system-generated links when a user shares an object with another user, schedules a Liveboard job, or runs SpotIQ analyses on a search answer.

ThoughtSpot sends these links in email notifications to allow the recipients to access a shared object or a Liveboard to which they have subscribed.
By default, the system-generated links point to the standalone ThoughtSpot application instance.

For an embedded ThoughtSpot instance, you might want to generate links in the format that preserves your host application context.
The *Links settings* menu in the *Develop* tab allows you to customize the format of links generated by ThoughtSpot.
