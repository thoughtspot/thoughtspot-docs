The stacked column chart is similar to the xref:chart-column.adoc[column chart], but with one major difference.
It includes a legend, which divides each column into additional sections, by color. Note that you can only use an attribute to slice with color.

Stacked column charts are typically used when you want to compare aggregated data and the data that it includes together.
You can select a configurable axis chip (any axis chip with a *>*) to show Detail Labels (summaries for each section of each bar) or Total Labels (show the sum of the stacks at the top of each stack).

You can also plot the y-axis as a percentage, adding up to 100%.
Select the attribute chip that you are using to *slice with color*.
Under *Format*, toggle *Stack 100%* on or off.
You can also toggle *Stack 100%* from an axis chip, as in the preceding image.
This feature is also available for stacked area and bar charts.

Your search needs at least two attributes and one measure to be represented as a stacked column chart.
