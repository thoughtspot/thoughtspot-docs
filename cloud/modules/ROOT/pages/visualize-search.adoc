:description: Visualize and save your ThoughtSpot Search results as Answers.




ThoughtSpot Search results generate tables and charts.
When you save them for future use, we call these saved searches Answers.

== Creating an Answer

To create a search, and save it as an Answer, follow these steps:

. Select *Search*.
. In the upper-right corner, select the data source icon.
. Under *Data*, select *Choose sources*.
+
Alternatively, select one of the sources that are already listed.

. In the *Choose sources* interface, select one or more sources, and select *Close*.
+
We strongly recommend that you use Worksheets rather than tables, because of the many benefits Worksheets provide.

. After you select the *Data Source*, start typing your question in the search bar.
. As you type each word of your search, ThoughtSpot helps you identify possible options, both from the data source and from its library of supporting terms and keywords.
. After you finish entering your search terms, select the *Return* or *Enter* key on your keyboard, click outside the search bar, or select the search icon at the right of the search bar.
+
You just created the first search result on your own data.

. Select the *More* icon image:icon-more-10px.png[more options menu icon], and select *Save*.
. In the *Save Answer* modal,
 ** Accept the suggested name, or enter a new name for your visualization.
 ** [Optional] Add a Description
 ** Select *Save*.

*_Congratulations!_* You have an Answer that you can use in your Liveboards.
To find this and other Answers, select *Answer* on the top navigation bar.
