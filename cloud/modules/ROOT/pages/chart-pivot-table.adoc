:description: A pivot table is a chart type.



Pivot tables enable you to explore an alternate visualization of your data in a wide, customizable table.
They allow you to visualize some of your data horizontally and some data vertically in the same table.
A pivot table is a chart time table that uses a drag-and-drop interface.

If you would like to visualize your search as a pivot table, click on the *change visualization* icon image:icon-chart-type-10px.png[] near the upper right of your screen, and select *pivot table*.
You need at least one attribute and one measure in your search.

You can restructure your pivot table by dragging and dropping the measures and attributes under *edit chart configuration* image:icon-gear-10px.png[], or by dragging and dropping column headings on the table itself. Note that you cannot drag a measure from the column heading to the row heading, as you would an attribute.


If you right-click a row or column heading, the system displays a contextual menu, allowing you to *exclude* or *include* values, xref:search-drill-down.adoc[drill down], *show underlying data*, *SpotIQ analyze*, *expand* or *collapse* the values in the row, or *sort*.

If you right-click a table cell, the system displays a contextual menu, allowing you to *exclude* or *include* values, xref:search-drill-down.adoc[drill down], *show underlying data*, or *SpotIQ analyze*.

If your pivot table contains multiple measures with long names, the column header now has a horizontal scroll bar, so you can see all your measures without taking up  excessive space in the pivot table.

== Sort
To sort any column or row, right-click on a row or column heading or subheading or a measure or attribute name and select **Sort**. You can also sort from the search bar. Type `sort by <column name> [ascending | descending]`.

You can sort a pivot table in many different ways. The ways you can sort a pivot table differ, depending on whether you are using the <<classic-experience,classic answer experience>> or the <<new-experience,new answer experience>>.

[#classic-experience]
=== Sort with the classic answer experience
If you use the classic answer experience, you have the following limitations:

* You can only sort on one attribute at a time.
* When you sort by a measure, it sorts both columns and rows.
* When you save a pivot table that you sorted, any sorts you added do not save.

[#new-experience]
=== Sort with the new answer experience
If you use the xref:answer-experience-new.adoc[new answer experience], you can sort in the following ways:

* You can sort on more than one attribute at a time, as long as it works within ThoughtSpot's logic. See the <<sorting-logic,sorting logic table>>.
* When you sort by a measure, you sort rows only. This allows you to sort the rows by a measure and the columns by an attribute. For example, in the sample pivot table at the beginning of the article, you can sort the rows by `Total sales` and the columns by `Store State`.
* When you save a pivot table that you sorted, all sorting saves as well.
* If you sort both from the search bar and from the in-context row or column heading menus, whichever sorting is the latest overrides the other. For example, if you right-click on a `Department` row heading and select *Sort ascending*, and then add `sort by date monthly` to the search bar, ThoughtSpot sorts only by `date monthly`.

[#sorting-logic]
.Sorting logic
|===
| Starting state | Add sort on row attribute | Add sort on column attribute | Add sort on measure

| No sorts in place | Adds sort | Adds sort | Adds sort, only across rows
| One or multiple sorts exist on row attributes | Adds sort | Adds sort | Overrides previous sorts and sorts based on the measure
| One or multiple sorts exist on column attributes | Adds sort | Adds sort | Adds sort, only across rows
| One sort on measure exists | Adds sort. Overrides previous sort by measure | Adds sort | Overrides previous sort by measure
| Sort on both row and column attributes exists | Adds sort | Adds sort | Adds sort. Overrides sort on row, retains sort on column
| Sort on column attribute and measure exists | Adds sort. Overrides sort on measure, retains sort on column | Adds sort | Adds sort. Overrides sort on measure, retains sort on column

|===

== Expand or contract columns and rows

Click on a column or row heading to expand it, or by right-clicking the arrow on the upper left of a row or column heading.

When you pin a pivot table to a Liveboard, it retains your expansion settings.

== Display totals

You can see your data as a percent of a row or column total, or as a percent of the grand total.
Grand totals aggregate all the data in your pivot table.

To see your data as a percent, click the *edit chart configuration* image:icon-gear-10px.png[] icon, and click *settings* at the bottom of the chart configuration panel.
Click on the dropdown menu to choose whether you want to see your data as a percent of a row or column total, or as a percent of the grand total.

image::chart-pivot-table-grand-total.png[See your data as a percent]

You only see 100% value when grand total rows is enabled.
When it is disabled, the rows and columns have no parental total column, so the percentage cannot be calculated.
All intermediate totals (columns or rows) display the percentage values calculated with respect to their parent.
For each inner summary (column or row) the parental total values are assumed to be 100% internally.

Select *Pivot Summaries* in the *Settings* menu to see row and column totals.

== Format row headers

You can view your row headers in a more compact (tree) layout.
To turn on compact row headers, select *Compact row headers* in the *Settings* menu.

image::chart-pivot-table-compact.png[Compact row headers]

You can change the type of total shown for an aggregated measure from the header menu that appears when you click on a header's *more* icon:

== Heatmap mode

The heatmap functionality allows you to see which measures contribute more to the total than others within the table.

image::chart-pivot-table-heatmap.png[Heatmap mode]

To turn on the heatmap, click the *edit chart configuration* image:icon-gear-10px.png[] icon, and click *settings* at the bottom of the chart configuration panel.
Select *heatmap mode*.

== Number and conditional formatting

You can perform conditional and number formatting on pivot tables.
Both these features work the same way they work for regular ThoughtSpot tables, except that you cannot set different conditional formatting rules for pivot table cells and pivot table column summaries.
Select *Edit chart configuration* image:icon-gear-10px.png[chart config icon], and click on the measure you would like to add number or conditional formatting to.
Refer to xref:search-conditional-formatting.adoc#table[Apply conditional formatting] and xref:chart-table.adoc#number-formatting[Number formatting] for more information.

== Pivot table limitations

The pivot table chart type has the following limitations:

* The pivot table displays a maximum of 100k rows.
If your query returns more than 100k rows, you cannot visualize it with a pivot table.
* If the query the pivot table is based on contains the `top` or `bottom` keyword, column and row summaries are not accurate.

* You cannot filter aggregated columns or columns with aggregated formulas.

* Pivot tables display your chosen measure(s) in the column row header, not in the row heading. ThoughtSpot does not support measures in the row heading.
