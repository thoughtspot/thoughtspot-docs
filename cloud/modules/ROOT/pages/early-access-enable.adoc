The Early Access features page lists features which a ThoughtSpot administrator can enable or disable. They are disabled by default.

NOTE: Early Access features which are not listed on this page, must be enabled by {support-url}.

== Early Access features in {version}

The following Early Access features can be enabled by your ThoughtSpot administrator:

New Navigation and Homepage::
Allow users to switch to the new home page and navigation from the user profile. For more information, see xref:user-profile.adoc#new-homepage-experience[Manage your navigation and home page experience].

New Experience (Default UI)::
Set the default home page and navigation (New or Classic) for all users across the instance. Users can change it later.
Changing from the classic to the new experience, requires New Navigation and Homepage to be enabled.

New Admin Experience::
Enables or disables a new UI for managing users, groups and roles which includes TML import and export. For more information, see xref:admin-portal-users.adoc[Managing users] and xref:admin-portal-groups.adoc[Managing groups in a single-tenant environment].

Advanced settings for charts::
Configure various chart settings like tooltips, data labels, grid lines, etc. For more information, see xref:chart-settings-advanced.adoc[Advanced chart settings].

Time Series Forecasting::
Forecast time-series KPI charts through SpotIQ Analyze to visualize future trends. For more information, see xref:spotiq-forecasting.adoc[Time-series forecasting].

Alerts by attribute::
Set alerts for a specific attribute to gain more granular KPI insights, monitoring changes for each attribute value. For more information, see xref:monitor-alert-attributes.adoc[Create an alert by attributes].

Add configurations to your connection::
Modify your connection settings by adding configurations based on your needs. Supported for Snowflake connections only at this time. For more information, see xref:connections-snowflake-add#additional-configurations-create[Creating additional configurations for your Snowflake connection].

Enable to create connections to a ClickHouse data warehouse to analyze data directly from your ClickHouse database. For more information, see xref:connections-clickhouse-add.adoc[Add a ClickHouse connection].

AI Highlights::

Toggle categories for connectors while creating a connection. For more information, see xref:connectors-categorization.adoc[Categorizing Connections].

OAuth Redirection Behavior::
When enabled, the OAuth authentication URL opens in the current page instead of a new tab or popup. Applies to Liveboards, search and Answers. For more information, see xref:single-window-oauth.adoc#_oauth_redirection_behavior[OAuth redirection behavior].

Automatic OAuth Sign-In Trigger::
When enabled, automatically triggers the 'Sign in with OAuth' screen when the connection's authentication has expired. Applies to Liveboards, search and Answers. For more information, see xref:single-window-oauth.adoc#_automatic_oauth_sign_in_trigger[Automatic OAuth Sign-in Trigger].

Selective User Access::
Provides selective access to ThoughtSpot pages through both the ThoughtSpot instance URL and the embedded content of your host application.

Reorder parameters::
When enabled, parameters can be re-ordered in both Liveboards and Answers. For more information, see xref:parameters-use.adoc#reorder-parameters[Using parameters].

Show relevant filters in Liveboard tab::
When enabled, if there are some filters or parameters which are only relevant to a specific tab within a Liveboard, only those filters and parameters will be visible in the tab by default. The rest will be hidden. For more information, see xref:liveboard-filters.adoc#relevant-filters[Apply filters to specific visualizations or tabs]

New Pivot table::
The new pivot table delivers faster performance, more customization options, and a superior user experience. For more information, see xref:chart-pivot-table.adoc#pivot-table-2-0[Pivot table charts].

Parameters in column names in charts and tables::
You can now add parameters in column names and axis names in charts and table headers. When a parameter value is changed, the visualization and contextual information update automatically. For more information, see xref:charts.adoc#parameters[Parameters in axis and column names of charts and tables].

New connection configuration experience::
Enable to switch to new connection configuration experience in the Data workspace. For more information, see xref:connection-configuration.adoc[New connection configuration experience].

PDF cover and filter page options::
When enabled, users can choose to include or exclude cover and filter pages in the Liveboard PDF. For more information, see xref:liveboard-download-pdf.adoc#pdf-pinboard[Download PDF in Liveboard format].

Query set::
A query set allows users to define a base search query to specify a list of values. With this list of values, the user can then define aggregate and multiple column grouping rules for cohort or bin analysis. The resulting set is available for use across many Answers. For more information, see xref:query-sets.adoc[Query sets].

Column set::
A column set allows users to define grouping rules or bins for the values of a specific column. The resulting set is available for use across many Answers. For more information, see xref:column-sets.adoc[Column sets].
