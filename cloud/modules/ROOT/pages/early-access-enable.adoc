:description: This page describes how administrators can enable or disable Early Access features.

Early Access features have new or enhanced functionality an administrator can typically enable. They are disabled by default.

NOTE: Some Early Access features must be enabled by {support-url}. Refer to the documentation for the specific Early Access feature to find out how it is enabled.

. Find the feature you want to enable, and click *Edit*.
. Click the status slider to set the feature to image:icon-slider-toggle-enable-20px.png[Early access features toggle] *Enabled*.
. Click *Save*.

== Disabling an Early Access feature
