You can filter a chart in two ways:

. Select the legend labels to toggle the values on or off.
. Follow the steps shown here to filter on the axis values.

To add a filter from the chart axes:

. While viewing your Answer as a chart, click the chart axis you want to filter on, and select *Filter*.

. The filter modals for attributes and measures are different.
The modal for an attribute looks like this:
+

+
The modal for a measure looks like this:
+
image::filter-measure.png[Measure filter]

. For an attribute filter, select values to include or exclude.
You can also *select all* or *clear all*.
If there are too many values, you can use the filter search bar to find the ones you want. The filter modal only shows 500 values; if the column you selected has more than 500 values, you must use the filter search bar to find the additional values.
. For a measure filter, select *Add a condition*.
Choose an operator, such as *is greater than*, and enter a number.
For example, to see under-performing stores, with sales under 10 million, select *is less than or equal to* and enter *10 million*.
To add another filter for that measure, select *Add another*.

NOTE: For chart axes that are aggregate measures on a higher level (for example, Total Sales), filtering is also done at the same level. For instance, in a Total Sales versus City chart, the Total Sales axis represents the sum of sales of all stores in a given city. Filters on the axis are applied on the sales numbers at the city level, not at the store level (as there are multiple stores in each city).
. Select *Done*.
