You can now use Glean to search unstructured data, such as documents, powerpoints, and excel files, directly from a Liveboard. Add a Glean tile to your Liveboard to easily add context to your ThoughtSpot data insights.


As a default, Glean inherits the title, filters, and parameters of your Liveboard as the default search query. You can configure Glean results to include or exclude these terms from your search. Glean results are tailored to each user based on their team, search activity, and preferences.

== Add Glean to your Liveboard

To add a Glean tile to your Liveboard, follow these steps:

. Enter your Liveboard and select *Edit* from the *more options* menu image:icon-more-10px.png[ellipsis icon].

. From the top menu bar that appears, select the *more options* icon image:icon-more-10px.png[ellipsis icon] and click *Add Glean*.

. In the log-in window that appears, enter the email address associated with your Glean account. Click *Enter*.

. The Glean tile appears. Glean takes the title of the Liveboard, as well as any filters and parameters defined in the Liveboard, as the default search query.
+
You can modify the search query by hovering over the tile, selecting the *more options* icon image:icon-more-10px.png[ellipsis icon], and clicking *Configure Glean. You can also use the menu to delete the Glean tile, or change the size of the tile.
