:description: You can add a regression line to your chart.

To add a regression line, you need a search with only one attribute and one measure.
Otherwise, this option is greyed out in the *settings* panel.
As soon as you modify the search to contain a single measure and attribute, the regression line option is clickable.

. While viewing your answer as a chart, click the *chart configuration* icon image:icon-gear-10px.png[] on the top right.
. Click *Settings* at the bottom of the *Customize* menu.
. Select *Regression line*.

You can show regression lines on most types of charts (bar, stacked bar, line,   bubble, and so on).
In the following examples, `sales` is the measure and `department` is   the attribute.
