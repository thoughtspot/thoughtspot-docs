== Configuring OAuth

If you plan to use OAuth with {connection}, you must configure it before you can create a connection. For details, see xref:connections-dremio-oauth.adoc[Configure OAuth for a {connection} connection].

== Adding a {connection} connection

To add a new connection to {connection}:

. Select *Data* in the top navigation bar.
. Open the *Connections* tab in the left navigation bar, and select the *Others* tile. Alternatively, select *+ Create new* in the left navigation bar, select *Connection*, and select the {connection} tile.
. Create a name for your connection, a description (optional), then select the {connection} connection type, and click *Continue*.

Refer to the xref:connections-dremio-reference.adoc[{connection} connection reference] for more information on each of the specific attributes you must enter for your connection.

. (Optional) Provide key-value pairs that you need to set up your connection to {connection} or customize additional JDBC parameters supported by {connection}, by doing the following:
** Select the *Advanced Config* menu to reveal the *Key* and *Value* fields.
** Enter your key and value information. Refer to the https://docs.dremio.com/software/drivers/dremio-jdbc-driver/?_ga=2.241665474.1502731465.1661547008-8281107.1661547008[Dremio JDBC documentation^].
** To add more keys and values, select the plus sign (+), and enter them.

+
NOTE: Any key-value pairs that you enter must be defined in your {connection} data source.
Key-value pairs are case-sensitive.

. Select *Continue*.

== Share a connection

Users with *can manage data* or *admin* privileges can share connections with other users or groups that have *can manage data* privileges. Once granted access to a connection, users can add, remove, and modify tables in that connection.

To share a connection with another user, follow these steps:

. Navigate to the *Data* tab and select *Connections*.

. Select the checkbox next to the name of the connection you want to share, and click *Share*.

. In the *Share connection* dialog, enter the ID of the user or group you want to share the connection with. You can use the search bar to find the user or group.

. Select *Done*.

Note that to remove share access from a connection, you must navigate to the *Share connection* dialog and select *Remove access* to the left of the user group or name.
