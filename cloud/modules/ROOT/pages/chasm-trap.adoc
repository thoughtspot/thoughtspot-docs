:description: A chasm trap occurs when two many-to-one joins converge on a single table.

In a complex schema, you may have a fact table with no relationship to another fact table, except that each contains a foreign key to a shared dimension table.
This is known as a chasm trap, and ThoughtSpot can handle it!

== Understand how chasm traps occur

A fact table, just as it sounds, stores facts about your business.
If you are selling apples, the sales fact table has facts about these apples.

|===
| SaleID | AppleTypeID | StoreID | Units Sold

| 4
| 55
| 2
| 12

| 8
| 34
| 33
| 3

Dimension tables describe the attributes that are interesting to analyze.
For example, the apple table might look like this.

|===
| AppleTypeID | Color | Name | Use

| 55
| Red
| Red Delicious
| Snack

| 34
| Green
| Granny Smith
| Cooking

| 09
| Yellow
| Golden
| Snack

As you can imagine, in a business you might have several fact tables that access dimension tables.
So, an apple business may record waste as well as sales.

|===
| TimeID | AppleTypeID | StoreID | Units Wasted

| 4
| 55
| 2

| 8
| 34

Both the sales and waste tables are facts that reference the apple dimension table.

A chasm trap in a data schema can introduce problems of over counting if you join the two fact tables through their shared dimension table.
This diagram shows a typical complex schema with several tables that are related over a chasm trap:

Examples of use cases where a chasm trap could occur when attribution analysis compare campaign data with purchase data, where all they have in common is that both contain a customer identifier that is a foreign key to a customer dimension table.
Chasm traps also occur, for example, in cost of sales analysis when wholesale orders data is only related to the retail sales data through a shared products dimension table.

In many databases, joining tables across a chasm trap creates a _Cartesian product_ or _cross join_.
That is each row from the first fact table is joined to each row from the second table.
A Cartesian product causes over counting when computing counts and aggregates.
ThoughtSpot protects you from this kind of over counting.

There are still just a few things to look out for when using a schema that contains chasm traps:

* The tables should be joined to the dimension table by an equi-join (a primary key/foreign key relationship).
They cannot be joined using a range of values.
* Review the column setting called xref:data-modeling-attributable-dimension.adoc#[Attribution Dimension].
You may need to change this setting if some of the columns in the shared dimension table should not be used for attribution when combining fact tables.
* Tables that will be joined across a chasm trap do not have to be co-sharded.
They will be joined appropriately automatically in the most efficient way.
