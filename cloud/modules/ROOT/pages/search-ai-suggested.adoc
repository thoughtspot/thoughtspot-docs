:description: AI-suggested searches help you think of business questions for your data.

AI-suggested searches help you think of relevant questions to ask of your data source, by providing example searches. This feature is designed to help you learn how to use the Search Data interface, and to gain insights when working with a new data set or worksheet.

AI-suggested searches are generated using GPT-3.5, a Large Language Model (LLM) by OpenAI. All users of a data source see the same set of suggested searches.

NOTE: The list of suggested searches is generated once for all worksheets.

== Using AI-suggested searches

To use AI-suggested searches, do the following:

. Click *Search Data*.
+
ThoughtSpot automatically selects the data source used in your most recent search. You can use the selected data source, or select a new one.
+
In the main area of the Search Data page, "New to search?" is displayed, and some suggested searches
are provided.

. Choose a suggested search, and click *Try this search*.
+
Once the search is complete, the answer is displayed.
. Review the answer, drill down on data points, or make changes to the query in the search bar as needed.
. (Optional) You can share feedback on the suggested search by clicking *Share Feedback*.
** Options include:
*** I am not interested in this question
*** The answer is not correct
*** Tell us how we can improve
** When you are ready to submit your feedback, click *Submit*.
+
Your feedback is collected by ThoughtSpot, and is used to improve suggested searches in the future.
. When you are done reviewing the answer, you can click *Clear* to go back to the Search Data page.

== When AI-suggested searches are not generated

AI-suggested searches are *not* shown under the following conditions:

- Search Assist is configured on the data source
+
If Search Assist is configured on some data sources, Search Assist will be displayed on the empty Search Data page. In those cases, AI-suggested searches are not shown.
- Multiple sources are selected
+
AI-suggested searches are not be available when you select multiple sources, because those types of searches are more commonly done by an advanced user, who doesn't rely on suggested searches.
- ThoughtSpot couldn't generate AI-suggested searches
+
AI-generated questions may not be available for some data sources if ThoughtSpot was unable to generate meaningful questions. Currently, this may happen with worksheets containing less than 5**&#8211;**10 columns.
