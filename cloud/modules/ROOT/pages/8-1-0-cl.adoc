[#spotapps]
ServiceNow SpotApp::
SpotApps are ThoughtSpot's new out-of-the-box solution templates built for specific use cases and data sources. They are built on Blocks, which are pre-built pieces of code that are easy to download and implement directly from the product. This release introduces the ServiceNow SpotApp and Analytics Blocks. Analytics Blocks include pre-built Worksheet, Answer, and Liveboard Blocks.
+
The ServiceNow SpotApp mimics the ServiceNow data model. After you connect to your ServiceNow data in your cloud data warehouse, ThoughtSpot maps that data to SpotApp columns, and creates pre-built but still customizable worksheets, answers, and Liveboards, based on your ServiceNow data.
+
This feature is in beta and off by default. It is part of the <<data-tab,Data tab redesign>>, which is also in beta and off by default. To enable SpotApps and the Data tab redesign, contact {support-url}.

SQL-based views::
This release introduces beta support for SQL-based views. Users can create views based on SQL queries, and use those views as data sources. This type of view has the same functionality as a view based on searching your data.
