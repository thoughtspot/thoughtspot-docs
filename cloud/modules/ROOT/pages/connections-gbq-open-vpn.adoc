Learn how to configure secure access from ThoughtSpot Cloud to your data in Google {connection}, through your OpenVPN server.

You can make your data in Google {connection} even more secure by connecting to your OpenVPN server.
This feature is also available for data in xref:connections-synapse-open-vpn.adoc[Azure Synapse or Snowflake on Azure].

Your company may have a policy that prohibits exposing your cloud data to the internet.
In this case, you can set up a VPN connection between your ThoughtSpot Cloud cluster and your data warehouse, either Google {connection} or Azure Synapse.

ThoughtSpot supports the following 3 OpenVPN servers:

* https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpn/latest/clientvpn-admin/what-is.html[AWS Client VPN]

== Set up an OpenVPN connection

You must perform several preliminary steps before asking {support-url} to connect your OpenVPN server to your ThoughtSpot cluster(s).

. Set up an *OpenVPN server*, on OpenVPN Community Edition, Azure VPN, or AWS Client VPN.
. Create your *OpenVPN configuration file* in `.ovpn` form.
The configuration file must be _one_ file, in `.ovpn` form.
To generate your configuration file, refer to these articles:

* https://openvpn.net/community-resources/creating-configuration-files-for-server-and-clients/[OpenVPN Community Edition]
* https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-howto-openvpn-clients[Azure VPN]
* https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpn/latest/clientvpn-admin/what-is.html[AWS Client VPN]

NOTE: Google {connection} does not support OpenVPN as a managed service. You must run a VM with OpenVPN.

== Send the configuration file to ThoughtSpot Support

Send the OpenVPN configuration file to {support-url}.

ThoughtSpot Support then configures the VPN on your ThoughtSpot Cloud cluster(s).

== Connect your ThoughtSpot cluster(s) to your data warehouse
