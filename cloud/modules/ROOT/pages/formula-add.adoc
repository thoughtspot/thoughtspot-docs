:description: Learn how to add a formula to a search.

NOTE: The new formula editor is part of the xref:answer-experience-new.adoc[new answer experience].
The new answer experience is on by default.
If you have the new answer experience on, the new version of the Formula Editor appears when you add a formula to a search, but not when you add a formula to a Worksheet.
You can turn the new answer experience on or off individually from the *Experience manager* panel in your profile.
If that option is not available, contact your administrator.

You can add a formula directly within a search.
Some common reasons for using a formula in a search are to perform mathematical functions, check for and replace null values, or add conditional logic.

== How to add a formula

To create a formula in a search:

. Start a new search, or choose an existing Answer to edit.
. Open the Data panel from the upper right corner if it is not open, and click the *+* icon next to Formulas.
If the xref:answer-experience-new.adoc[new answer experience] is off in your environment, click the *more options* icon image:icon-more-10px.png[more options menu icon] in the upper-right side of the table, and select *Add formula*.

. Name and enter your formula in the Formula Editor.
The new Formula Editor supports multi-line wrapping of long formulas.
To continue the formula on a new line, press *Enter* or *return* on your keyboard.

NOTE: Formula elements are color-coded by type and can include the formula operators and functions (blue), the names of columns (purple), and/or constants (black).

. You can see a list of formula operators with examples by selecting the help icon *?* in the upper right corner.
If the new answer experience is off in your environment, click *Formula Assistant*.
Expand a category, such as *Comparison*, and click on a formula operator for a definition and example.

. To change what your formula returns, use the *Advanced settings*.
Select the settings icon image:icon-gear-10px.png[] in the upper right corner.
If the new answer experience is off in your environment, select *Settings*.
Depending on your formula, you may be able to change the following aspects:
 ** *Data type*: Determines the type of data that the formula generates.
For example, use `date` for an `add_days` formula.
 ** *Measure or attribute*: Determines if the output of the formula is a measure or an attribute.
For example, choose `attribute` for a formula that generates age groups, and choose `measure` for a formula that generates profit.
 ** *Aggregation*: Determines the default aggregation of the formula output.
For example, choose `min` to see minimum profit.
