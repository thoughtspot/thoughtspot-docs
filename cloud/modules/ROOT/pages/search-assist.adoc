:description: Use Search Assist to learn how to get original answers to all your business questions.


ThoughtSpot uses a simple search approach to generate tables and visualizations. Use Search Assist to learn how to get original answers to all your business questions.

Search Assist walks you through simple search scenarios, using data from the Sample Retail xref:system-worksheet.adoc[system worksheet].
It demonstrates how anyone can get answers to their data questions by typing in the Search bar.

The initial example asks, *_What were Sales by Product in this year?_*

Search Assist guides you to search for *_sales_* and press *Enter* on your keyboard.

The search then returns the answer as a table, demonstrating your total sales.

Next, you add *_product_* to your search and press *Enter*.
Now you see a table with the total sales for each product.

Last, you add *_this year_* to your search and press *Enter*.
Now you see a table with the total sales for each product, filtered to only show the data from this year.

Search Assist shows you where the filter bar is, and how to view your search as a chart.

To continue learning how to use Search, select *Try another search*.
The additional searches also return answers, either in table form or as chart, to these questions:
