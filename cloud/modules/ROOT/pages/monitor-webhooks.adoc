You can create webhooks to initiate workflows in third-party applications based on KPI changes, or send KPI alert notifications to custom channels.

For example, if you are monitoring a "current inventory" KPI for an inventory management use case, you can build a workflow to trigger an order placement in a third-party app when your current inventory drops below a particular threshold value.

Webhooks must be created by a developer or administrator through the *Develop* tab, but once created, can be used by any user. For information on how to create a webhook, see the link:https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/webhooks#_webhook_schema[Developer documentation].


== Use a webhook

To connect your KPI to a webhook, follow these steps:

. Create the Monitor alert, by either of the following methods:

* Open the Liveboard containing the KPI chart and click on the bell icon that appears when you hover over the chart.
* Open the KPI as an Answer in the *Search data* tab, select the more options icon image:icon-more-10px.png[more options icon], and click *Create alert*.

. Fill in the fields to set up a threshold or scheduled alert. Under *Select notification channel*, click *Custom channel*.

. From the dropdown menu that appears, select the name of your webhook.

. Click *Create alert*. Now, your KPI is set to send information to your webhook, either on a set schedule, or when a specific threshold is reached.
