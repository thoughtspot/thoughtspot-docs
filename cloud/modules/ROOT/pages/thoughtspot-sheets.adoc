ThoughtSpot Connected Sheets is an add-on that allows you to connect to a ThoughtSpot instance, pull data directly into a Google Sheet from trusted data sources connected to that instance (like Snowflake, Google BigQuery(TM), DataBricks, and others), and use the tools in Google Sheets(TM) for ad-hoc analysis.
