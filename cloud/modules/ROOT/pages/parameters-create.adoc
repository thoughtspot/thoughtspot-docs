:description: Create Worksheet Parameters to optimize your data inquiries.

A Parameter is a container or a placeholder such as a number, date, or string that can replace a constant value or a list of values. Create Worksheet Parameters to optimize your data inquiries. Use Parameters to run different scenarios with adjustable values, without creating or modifying the constants in formulas for each new value.

Parameters are useful for 'what-if' analysis, financial planning, cohort analysis, and so on. When you create Parameters for your Worksheet, you guide users in their exploration of the data as they search on your Worksheet or use Liveboards based on your Worksheets.

== Creating Parameters
There is no maximum number of Parameters you can create for a single Worksheet. However, Parameters don't work across Worksheets. They only affect a single Worksheet.

To create a Parameter, follow these steps:

. Navigate to the Worksheet to which you would like to add a Parameter.
. Select *Edit Worksheet* in the upper right corner.
. In the *Data* panel on the left of your screen, select the *+* button that appears when you hover over the *Parameters* section.
+

. The *Create parameter* dialog appears:
+

. In the *Parameter name* text box, enter a name for your Parameter. This name should be unique for the Worksheet and easy for users to understand.
. Optionally, enter a description for the Parameter in the *Add a description* text box. Use this field to add additional information users might need before using this Parameter in their analysis. It is a best practice to use this field to specify the formulas this Parameter is used in, in addition to any other information you add.
. Under *Data settings*, specify the data type the Parameter must be: Integer, Double, String, Boolean, or Date. For more information about data types, refer to xref:data-types.adoc[].
. For integer, double, or date data types, specify the allowed values: *Any*, *List*, or *Range*. For the string data type, specify either *Any* or *List*.

Allows any value within the data type's constraints.
List:: Allows values only in the list you create. Enter a value in the *Enter value...* text box, and optionally enter what the value should display as in the *Display as...* text box. To add more values, select *+ Add row*. To delete values, select the *x* to the right of the row the value is in.
+

Range:: Allows values only within the range you specify. In the *Minimum value* and *Maximum value* text boxes, specify the values the range begins and ends with.

. For the boolean data type, optionally set custom names for `true` and `false`; for example, `0` and `1`.
. Set the default value for your Parameter. In the default value text box, enter the value this Parameter should default to. For the boolean data type, the *Default value* option is a dropdown.  `true` and `false` are the only options.
. Select *Save*.
. Save your Worksheet. Select *Save* in the upper right corner.

== Editing and deleting Parameters

To edit or delete existing Parameters, follow these steps.

NOTE: You can only delete Parameters that are not in use in any formula, Answer, or Liveboard. If a Parameter is in use in any objects, you must first remove the Parameter from these dependents, then delete the Parameter. For Parameters that are in use, you can only edit the following fields: *Name*, *Description*, and *Default value*.

. Navigate to the Worksheet with the Parameter you would like to edit or delete.
. Select *Edit Worksheet* in the upper right corner.
. In the *Data* panel on the left of your screen, select the *Down* arrow to the right of the *Parameters* section. This expands the list of Parameters.
. To *edit* a Parameter, select the edit icon image:icon-edit-10px.png[edit icon image] to the right of the Parameter name.
+
Note that you may not be able to edit all fields, if the Parameter is in use in formulas, Answers or Liveboards. For Parameters that are in use, you can only edit the following fields: *Name*, *Description*, and *Default value*. To edit other fields, you must first remove it from these Answers and Liveboards. To see which Answers and Liveboards use the Parameter, select *View Details* in the *Edit parameter* dialog that appears.
. Make your changes, and select *Save*.
. To *delete* a Parameter, select the delete icon image:icon-delete-10px.png[Delete icon image] to the left of the Parameter name.
+
Note that you may not be able to delete the Parameter, if the Parameter is in use in Answers or Liveboards. You must first remove it from these Answers and Liveboards. To see which Answers and Liveboards use the Parameter, select *View Details* in the *Delete this parameter* dialog that appears.
. Select *Delete* in the dialog that appears.
. Save your Worksheet. Select *Save* in the upper right corner.

== Using Parameters

After you create Parameters for your data, use them to run different scenarios when searching on your data or viewing Liveboards or Answers. To learn how to use Parameters, see xref:parameters-use.adoc[].
