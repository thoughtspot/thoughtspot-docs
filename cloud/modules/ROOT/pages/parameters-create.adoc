:description: Create Worksheet and Answer parameters to optimize your data inquiries.

A parameter is a container or a placeholder such as a number, date, or string that can replace a constant value or a list of values. Create <<worksheet,Worksheet>> and <<answer,Answer>> parameters to optimize your data inquiries. Use parameters to run different scenarios with adjustable values, without creating or modifying the constants in formulas for each new value.

parameters are useful for 'what-if' analysis, financial planning, cohort analysis, and so on. When you create parameters for your Worksheets, you guide users in their exploration of the data as they search on your Worksheets or use Liveboards based on your Worksheets. When you create parameters for your Answers, you empower yourself and other viewers of your Answers to run scenarios on the data in the Answer, using adjustable values.

IMPORTANT: For a parameter to be used in a Liveboard, you must create it in a Worksheet.

== Creating parameters
There is no maximum number of parameters you can create for a single <<worksheet,Worksheet>> or <<answer,Answer>>. However, parameters don't work across Worksheets or Answers. They only affect a single Worksheet or Answer.

== Editing and deleting parameters

To edit or delete existing parameters, follow these steps.

NOTE: You can only delete parameters that are not in use in any formula, Answer, or Liveboard. If a parameter is in use in any objects, you must first remove the parameter from these dependents, then delete the parameter. For parameters that are in use, you can only edit the following fields: *Name*, *Description*, and *Default value*.

=== Editing and deleting Worksheet parameters

. Navigate to the Worksheet with the parameter you would like to edit or delete.
. Select *Edit Worksheet* in the upper right corner.
. In the *Data* panel on the left of your screen, select the *Down* arrow to the right of the *Parameters* section. This expands the list of parameters.
. To *edit* a parameter, select the edit icon image:icon-edit-10px.png[edit icon image] to the right of the parameter name.

Note that you may not be able to edit all fields, if the parameter is in use in formulas, Answers or Liveboards. For parameters that are in use, you can edit the following fields: *Name*, *Description*, *Allowed values*, and *Default value*. You can also add or delete values from a list parameter while it's in use, or increase or decrease the minimum and maximum values in a range parameter.
+
To edit other fields, you must first remove it from these Answers and Liveboards. To see which Answers and Liveboards use the parameter, select *View Details* in the *Edit parameter* dialog that appears.
. Make your changes, and select *Save*.
. To *delete* a parameter, select the delete icon image:icon-delete-10px.png[Delete icon image] to the left of the parameter name.
