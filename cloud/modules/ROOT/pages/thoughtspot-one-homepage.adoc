[#search-existing]
== Search across existing Answers and Liveboards

include::partial$search-answers-description.adoc[]


The home page displays the *Search Answers* experience by default.
You can select a specific Worksheet from the *Sources* dropdown menu to the left of the search bar, or search across all Worksheets that you have access to.
Type your query into the search bar at the top of the screen.
Select *Go* or click Enter on your keyboard.
For example, search `sales in the last year bob` if you are looking for a particular Liveboard about sales that your coworker Bob made.
This type of search does not require you to be extensively familiar with your company's data and how it is organized.

See xref:search-answers.adoc[Search Answers] for more information on searching across existing objects.

[#search-data]
== Search your data

You can search directly on your data.
Use this functionality if you would like to create your own Answers and Liveboards to answer questions about your data.

To search your data, select the *Search data* button in the top navigation bar. The *Search data* page appears.
Select a data source to search on, and type your query into the search bar at the top of the screen.
Select *Go* or click Enter on your keyboard.
For example, search `sales last year store #103 bakery` to see last year's sales in the bakery department for store 103.
This type of search requires you to be familiar with your company's data, to know which Worksheets contain data that interests you, and the names of the columns and values within that Worksheet.

See xref:search-data.adoc[Searching data] for more information on searching your data.

[#quick-links]
== Track important metrics

When you first view the ThoughtSpot home page, you may see a row of popular metrics for your company just below the Search bar.
This watchlist may be empty, if your company is new to ThoughtSpot.
Use this watchlist to view and track metrics you reference often.
For example, a VP of Sales might track _Number of new deals this month_, while a product manager might track _NPS score_.
You can also select these metrics to access the Liveboard they come from, either in the same tab or in a new tab. You can have any number of metrics on your watchlist at a time.

To add metrics to your watchlist, follow these steps:

. Select *Add metrics to your watchlist* from the end of the row of existing metrics you are tracking.
+
You may need to use the right arrow button to get to the *Add metrics to your watchlist* option, if you already track several metrics.
. The *Add metrics* window modal appears, showing the metrics on the Liveboard you most recently viewed.
To find metrics from another Liveboard you would like to add, search for that Liveboard using the search bar near the upper left of the *Add metrics* window.
. Select a metric or multiple metrics, and click *Add metrics*.

You can arrange the metric cards in 2 ways:

* *Drag and drop*: Move the metric cards to different positions in your watchlist using drag and drop.
* *More options image:icon-more-10px.png[more options menu icon] icon*: You can replace or delete a metric, move it one spot to the left or right, make a card the first one in the row, or insert another card to the right or left of a specific card.

NOTE: If you can no longer access a metric on your watchlist (because the headline or Liveboard was deleted, or your access permissions changed), the system displays a note saying you cannot view that metric.

=== Liveboards with mandatory filters
If you want to add a metric from a Liveboard that has a xref:liveboard-filters-mandatory.adoc[mandatory filter], you must first navigate to the Liveboard and specify a value for the mandatory filter. If you do not specify a value, ThoughtSpot doesn't let you add any of the metrics from that Liveboard to your watchlist.
