[#search-existing]
== Search across existing Answers and Liveboards

include::partial$search-answers-description.adoc[]


The home page displays the *Search Answers* experience by default.
You can select a specific Worksheet from the *Sources* dropdown menu to the left of the search bar, or search across all Worksheets that you have access to.
Type your query into the search bar at the top of the screen.
Select *Go* or click Enter on your keyboard.
For example, search `sales in the last year bob` if you are looking for a particular Liveboard about sales that your coworker Bob made.
This type of search does not require you to be extensively familiar with your company's data and how it is organized.

See xref:search-answers.adoc[Search Answers] for more information on searching across existing objects.

[#search-data]
== Search your data

You can search directly on your data.
Use this functionality if you would like to create your own Answers and Liveboards to answer questions about your data.

To search your data, select the *Search data* button in the top navigation bar. The *Search data* page appears.
Select a data source to search on, and type your query into the search bar at the top of the screen.
Select *Go* or click Enter on your keyboard.
For example, search `sales last year store #103 bakery` to see last year's sales in the bakery department for store 103.
This type of search requires you to be familiar with your company's data, to know which Worksheets contain data that interests you, and the names of the columns and values within that Worksheet.

See xref:search-data.adoc[Searching data] for more information on searching your data.

[#quick-links]
== Track important KPIs

When you first view the ThoughtSpot home page, you may see a row of popular KPIs for your company just below the Sage search bar.
This watchlist may be empty, if your company is new to ThoughtSpot.
Use this watchlist to view and track KPIs you reference often.
For example, a VP of Sales might track _Number of new deals this month_, while a product manager might track _NPS score_.
You can also select these KPIs to access the Liveboard they come from, either in the same tab or in a new tab. You can have any number of KPIs on your watchlist at a time.

To add KPIs to your watchlist, follow these steps:

. Select *Add KPIs to your watchlist*.

. The *Add KPIs* window modal appears, showing the KPIs on the Liveboard you most recently viewed.
To find KPIs from another Liveboard you would like to add, search for that Liveboard using the search bar near the upper left of the *Add KPIs* window.
. Select a KPI or multiple KPIs, and click *Add KPIs*.
+
[#monitor]
NOTE: When you add a KPI to your home page watchlist, ThoughtSpot automatically creates a scheduled alert, based on the KPI's cadence. If you set a KPI to update weekly, you receive an alert on each Monday. If you set a KPI to update monthly, you receive an alert on the first of every month. All KPI alerts trigger at 9 AM PST for each cadence. You can edit all scheduled alerts from the *Monitor* tab or from the email alert.

You can arrange the KPI cards in 2 ways:

* *Drag and drop*: Move the KPI cards to different positions in your watchlist using drag and drop.
* *More options image:icon-more-10px.png[more options menu icon] icon*: You can replace or delete a KPI, move it one spot to the left or right, make a card the first one in the row, or insert another card to the right or left of a specific card.

NOTE: If you can no longer access a KPI on your watchlist (because the KPI chart or Liveboard was deleted, or your access permissions changed), the system displays a note saying you cannot view that KPI.
