:description: A pie chart divides data into slices to illustrate numerical proportion. The arc length of a slice is proportional to the quantity it represents.

The pie chart is a classic chart type that displays your search in a circle.
The default pie chart in ThoughtSpot displays data in the shape of a doughnut, or a thick ring.

== How pie charts divide data

Pie charts divide your data into sectors that each represent a proportion of a whole circle.
To display the exact values of each slice and the percentage values, select the *Chart configuration* icon image:icon-gear-10px.png[] > *Settings* > *All labels*.

Your search needs at least one attribute and one measure to be represented as a pie chart.
Also, there must be fewer than 50 values in the attribute column.

== Pie in pie charts

The pie in pie chart can be created from a regular pie chart in order to compare more than one component of an attribute.
Pie in pie charts show two concentric pie charts comparing different measures.

To see a pie in pie chart, assign two different measures to the *Size* section under *Edit chart configuration* image:icon-gear-10px.png[].

== Color customization of pie in pie charts

You can customize the colors of each pie in a pie chart using the Style widget. Note that if you have a pie in pie chart, you change the colors for both widgets that apply to the same attribute value.

. Select the *Chart configuration* icon image:icon-gear-10px.png[].
. Under *Category*, select the attribute whose colors you would like to change.
. Click on the *Color* dropdowns for each attribute value and change them.
. Click the *x* in the top right of the panel.
. Optionally, you can click *Reset* to use the default color.
. Save your changes.

== Limitations
Pie charts do *_NOT_* support conditional formatting.
