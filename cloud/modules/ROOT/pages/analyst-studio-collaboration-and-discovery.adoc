== My Work

Click *My Work* image:nav-my-work.svg[my work] on the left side of your {product} home page to show all of the Reports you have created in this Workspace, regardless of where (that is, in which Collection) those Reports currently live.

== Recently viewed
//+++<flag-icon>++++++</flag-icon>+++

Click *Recently Viewed*  on the left side of your {product} home page to view an ordered list of all the Reports you recently viewed, starting from the most recent, no matter where those Reports currently live or who created them.

== Pin a Report
//+++<flag-icon>++++++</flag-icon>+++

Help your teammates find the analysis they need by pinning essential Reports to the top of a Collection,
ensuring that anyone viewing that Collection will see the Report at the top of the list.
To pin a Report:

. Navigate to the Collection where the Report you want to pin is located.
. Hover over the Report thumbnail, and then click on the *More* image:menu-dots-gray-press.svg[more menu] button in the upper right corner.
. Click *Pin in this Collection* and the Report will jump to the top of the list.

To unpin a Report in a Collection, repeat the above steps and click *Unpin from this space* in Step 3.

NOTE: Pinning is not supported for xref:analyst-studio-spaces.adoc#personal-space[personal Collections].

[#report-shortcut]
== Report shortcut
//+++<flag-icon>++++++</flag-icon>+++

You can use shortcuts to make a Report accessible from multiple open Collections.
While a Report can only ever live in one Collection at a time, you can create shortcuts to a Report from as many public Collections as you want.
To create a shortcut to a Report:

. Navigate to the Collection where the Report is located.
. Hover over the Report thumbnail, and then click on the *More* image:menu-dots-gray-press.svg[more menu] button in the upper right corner.
. Click *Create shortcut...* in the dropdown.
. In the pop-up, find the Collection from which you want to create the shortcut and click on it.
. Click *Create*.
+
NOTE: Shortcuts cannot be created in private Collections, and shortcuts cannot be created to Reports in private Collections.

Deleting a Report shortcut does not affect the original Report.
To delete a Report shortcut:

. Navigate to the Collection where the shortcut is located.
. Hover over the shortcut thumbnail, and then click on the *More* image:menu-dots-gray-press.svg[more menu] button in the upper right corner.
. Click *Remove shortcut...* in the dropdown.

== Search

To easily navigate to Reports, Datasets, and Collections in {product}, click the magnifying glass icon in the top right to use the search bar, or use the keyboard shortcut (kbd:[`Cmd`] / kbd:[`Ctrl`] + kbd:[`K`]).
Search by title, description, or query keywords like column names to find the content you need.

=== Keyboard shortcuts

* Open the search window: kbd:[`Cmd`] / kbd:[`Ctrl`] + kbd:[`K`]
* Use up/down arrow keys to navigate through search results.
* Open result in a new tab: kbd:[`Cmd`] / kbd:[`Ctrl`] + kbd:[`Enter`]
* Open result in current tab: kbd:[`Enter`]

=== Filtering search results

Use filters to narrow down your search results:

* Filter by type - Reports, Datasets, Collections.
* Specify what you want your search to match on.
Collections can only match on name and description.
* Filter to content created by you.

== FAQs

[discrete]
=== *Q: Is there a way I can track who edits a Report or query?*

We currently don't log the edit history, however, you should be able to see the query run history of a Report by navigating to *View Details > Details*, and scrolling to the bottom.

You can also see the query run history, including who had run the query and the code written, when you click the 'View history' button in the editor:

That will then bring up the following screen:

Another option we suggest is using GitHub Sync to track all changes made to a Report, so you can go on the GitHub repo to track exactly what changes are made at what time, and who made the changes.
You can learn more about GitHub Sync xref:analyst-studio-github.adoc#mode-github[here].
