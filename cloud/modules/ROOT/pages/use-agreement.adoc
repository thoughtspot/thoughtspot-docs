:description: An administrator must accept the ThoughtSpot use agreement in the application to allow users to continue using the application.

An administrator must accept the ThoughtSpot use agreement in the application to allow users to continue using the application.

Prior to ThoughtSpot Cloud 5, administrators signed a paper use agreement to allow their users to use ThoughtSpot.
Starting with Cloud 5, you can easily sign the use agreement from the application itself.
You can view a copy of this agreement at https://www.thoughtspot.com/legal/thoughtspot-cloud-subscription-agreement[ThoughtSpot Legal].

NOTE: Even if you previously signed a paper copy of the use agreement, an admin *_must_* accept the agreement in the application.

== Use agreement notifications

When ThoughtSpot upgrades your cluster to Cloud 5, or when there is a new version of the use agreement later, administrators receive notifications about the use agreement.
You do not receive notifications about the use agreement with every software upgrade, just with upgrades that include changes to the use agreement.
Administrators receive the following notification, which allows them to accept the use agreement:

One administrator for each cluster must accept this agreement within 30 days of ThoughtSpot upgrading your cluster to Cloud 5.
If an administrator does not sign the agreement within 30 days, users cannot access the ThoughtSpot application.
Administrators receive a when they try to use ThoughtSpot, which allows them to accept the use agreement to continue using ThoughtSpot: "To continue using ThoughtSpot, please accept https://www.thoughtspot.com/legal/thoughtspot-cloud-subscription-agreement[the terms]."

If an administrator does not sign the agreement within 30 days of ThoughtSpot upgrading the cluster to Cloud 5, non-admin users receive the following notification when they try to use ThoughtSpot.
The notification tells them to ask their administrator to accept the use agreement to allow them to continue using ThoughtSpot: "To continue using ThoughtSpot, please ask your administrator to accept the use agreement."

== Accept the use agreement

Only administrators can accept the use agreement.
Only one administrator needs to accept the use agreement for each cluster.
Note that you must sign an agreement for each of your clusters.
