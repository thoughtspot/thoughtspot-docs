:description: ThoughtSpot now supports rolling time windows, as well as fixed date ranges for Search.

We have increased the possible range of dates you can use to filter your Answers and Liveboards. Previously, when adding a date using the filter from the side bar, users were limited to the following conditions: `On (=) <date>`, `On or after (>=) <date>`, `Before (<) <date>`, and `Between <date> and <date>`. Now, we support rolling time windows, as well as fixed date ranges.

For a complete list of the date options ThoughtSpot supports for Answers and Liveboards, see the following options:


. Rolling time windows. Note that in this context, s/m/h/D/W/M/Q/Y means seconds/minutes/hours/days/weeks/months/quarters/years.

* Yesterday
* Today
* Tomorrow

. All other time windows.

* Multiple conditions e.g. if a user enters “last 30 days next 1 week” or “date != 1 Jan date > 30 Dec”. This would include conditions like “Last/Next X m/h/D/W/M/Q/Y To Last/Next X s/m/h/D/W/M/Q/Y”.
* Is empty / Is not empty (i.e. = null / not null)
