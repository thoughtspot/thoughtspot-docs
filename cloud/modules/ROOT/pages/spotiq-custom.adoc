:description: Learn how to customize SpotIQ analysis.

Everywhere in ThoughtSpot where you can run *SpotIQ analyze*, you can configure a customized SpotIQ analysis.
The customized analysis can be a one-time customization or can apply to all future analysis of that particular data source.

== Finding customization controls

Every menu or location where you can run *SpotIQ analyze*, you can customize your analysis.
You access it using the lightbulb button image:icon-lightbulb.png[lightbulb icon] or the *more options* menu image:icon-more-10px.png[SpotIQ analyze icon].

== SpotIQ window layout

Depending on whether you are using the <<new-answer-experience, new Answer and Liveboard experiences>> or the <<classic-experiences,classic experiences>>, the SpotIQ analysis window has a different layout.

[#new-answer-experience]
=== SpotIQ in the new Answer and Liveboard experiences

. On the new Answer and Liveboard experiences, the SpotIQ analysis window first asks you what kind of analysis you would like to do:
+
image::spotiq-analyze-choose.png[Choose analysis type]

 ** Outlier analysis: finds underlying anomalies or outliers
 ** Trend analysis: finds interesting trends in the underlying data
 ** Cross-correlation analysis: determines how your metrics correlate with other measures
 ** Change analysis: if you select 2 or more data points, you can run a change analysis on those points.
Otherwise, ThoughtSpot does not show you this option.

. Next, SpotIQ recommends certain columns for analysis.
You can select all columns in the Answer, clear all columns, or search for more columns to include.
+

. You can also customize advanced parameters.
Select *Customize parameters*, on the *Select measures and attributes* page.
The following screen appears.
Scroll down to see more options, including customizations for specific analysis types.
+

+
You can customize the following parameters for any SpotIQ analysis _except_ a change analysis:

 ** General settings: exclude null values, restrict analysis to the current result set only, exclude zero values, or auto-tune date boundaries
 ** Insight count settings: choose the maximum number of measure and attribute columns to analyze

+
You can customize the following parameters for an outlier analysis:

 ** Outlier algorithm: choose the method of outlier detection (z-scores or median z-scores, Seasonal Hybrid ESD, or Linear Regression)
 ** Outlier parameters: choose the minimum rows required for analysis, multiplier for outlier detection, and maximum P-Value
 ** Insight count settings: choose the maximum outlier detection insights, maximum seasonality detection insights, and maximum linear regression insights

+
You can customize the following parameters for a trend analysis:

 ** Trend parameters: specify the minimum rows required for analysis, maximum P-Value, and minimum relative difference
 ** Insight count settings: specify the maximum trend insights

+
You can customize the following parameters for a cross-correlation analysis:

 ** Cross-correlation parameters: choose the minimum rows required for analysis, minimum correlation coefficient, maximum correlation coefficient, and maximum correlation lag
 ** Insight count settings: choose the maximum cross-correlation insights

+
You can customize the following parameters for a change analysis:

 ** Change analysis parameters: specify the maximum difference elements, the maximum fraction, minimum abs change ratio, and minimum change ratio

+
You can also reset these parameters to their system defaults.
Select *Reset to system default* in the lower-left corner of the SpotIQ modal.

. Select *Analyze*.

[#classic-experiences]
=== SpotIQ in the classic Answer and Liveboard experiences

On the classic Answer and Liveboard experiences, the SpotIQ analysis window has two tabs:

* *Columns*, where you can explicitly indicate which columns to include in a SpotIQ analysis.
(You can select all, some, or none.)
* *Advanced*, where you can run custom analyses and incorporate R scripts into SpotIQ.

The *Advanced* tab has many options.
The panel scrolls, so more algorithms are available than appear in the following image.

The *SpotIQ* insights page has an option to customize a single analysis. Select *Customize analysis* in the upper-right corner.

image::spotiq-customize-locations.png[Select Customize analysis in the upper right corner.]

The *Tell us more* window provides information on how to exclude a value from all future analysis.

image::spotiq-customize-improve-analysis.png[Feedback pop-up]

Eliminate null values::
Null values should be eliminated from your analysis.
From next analysis;; In the *Search* bar, add a filter `column!= Null` to the search bar. Or choose *Exclude null values from current analysis*, using the *Advanced* panel.
From future analyses;; Set *Exclude null values from my analysis* on your user *Profile* to exclude them from any future SpotIQ analyses you do.

Exclude uninteresting column(s) in insight::
You should always exclude columns you are not interested from your analysis.
From next analysis;; Use the *EXCLUDE* option of *SPOTIQ PREFERENCE* under the *DATA* tab to exclude any column permanently from all future analysis.
From future analyses;; Not applicable.

Include an interesting column::
You can always include columns that interest you in your analysis.
From next analysis;; Choose *Customize analysis* and select columns that you want to include.
From future analyses;; Ensure *Index Priority* is between 8-10 on the column under the *DATA* tab.

Remove known date outliers::
Your data may contain known outliers. +
For example, you are in the middle of a quarter and only want to analyze the previous quarter. Anything from the present quarter could contain an outlier.

From next analysis;; In the *Search* bar, add a filter date< last time period to the search bar.
From future analyses;; Not applicable.

Too few insights::
Your SpotIQ analysis may not provide you as many insights as you think it should.
From next analysis;; Choose *Customize analysis*, select the *Advanced tab*, and decrease the *Multiplier for Outlier Detection* to a value closer to zero.
From future analyses;; Not applicable.
