:description: Learn how to customize SpotIQ analysis.
:jira: SCAL-202496

Everywhere in ThoughtSpot where you can run *SpotIQ analyze*, you can configure a customized SpotIQ analysis.
The customized analysis can be a one-time customization or can apply to all future analysis of that particular data source.

== Finding customization controls

Every menu or location where you can run *SpotIQ analyze*, you can customize your analysis.
You access it using the light bulb button image:icon-lightbulb.png[lightbulb icon] or the *more options* menu image:icon-more-10px.png[SpotIQ analyze icon].

== SpotIQ window workflow

. The SpotIQ analysis window first asks you what kind of analysis you would like to do:
+
image::spotiq-analyze-choose.png[Choose analysis type]

 ** Outlier analysis: finds underlying anomalies or outliers
 ** Trend analysis: finds interesting trends in the underlying data
 ** Cross-correlation analysis: determines how your metrics correlate with other measures
 ** Change analysis: if you select 2 or more data points, you can run a change analysis on those points.
Otherwise, ThoughtSpot does not show you this option.
+
NOTE: If you enable xref:spotiq-forecasting.adoc[Forecasting], SpotIQ only allows you to run one kind of analysis at a time. If you disable Forecasting, you will be able to multi-select.

. Next, SpotIQ recommends certain columns for analysis.
You can select all columns in the Answer, clear all columns, or search for more columns to include.

 ** Insight count settings: choose the maximum outlier detection insights, maximum seasonality detection insights, and maximum linear regression insights

+
You can customize the following parameters for a trend analysis:

 ** Trend parameters: specify the minimum rows required for analysis, maximum P-Value, and minimum relative difference
 ** Insight count settings: specify the maximum trend insights

You can customize the following parameters for a cross-correlation analysis:

 ** Cross-correlation parameters: choose the minimum rows required for analysis, minimum correlation coefficient, maximum correlation coefficient, and maximum correlation lag
 ** Insight count settings: choose the maximum cross-correlation insights
