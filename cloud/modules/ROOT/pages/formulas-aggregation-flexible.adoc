:description: Use the group_aggregate function in ThoughtSpot to aggregate measures at different granularities than the dimensions used in the search columns.

== How aggregation formulas work

Typically, the groupings and filters used in a formula use the same fields as columns returned in the search results.
The concept of a grouping equates to an attribute column.

For example, in the search `revenue ship mode`, `revenue` is the measure, and `ship mode` is the attribute, or grouping.
The result of this search shows total revenue for each ship mode:

[cols="20%,80%"]
|===
| revenue | ship mode

| $ _a_
| air

| $ _r_
| rail

| $ _t_
| truck

| $ _s_
| sea transport
|===

The aggregation formulas are described in xref:formulas-aggregation.adoc#[Overview of aggregate formulas].

== About flexible aggregation

ThoughtSpot provides flexible aggregation with the `group_*` functions.
You can use `group_*` formulas when you want to specify columns and filters to include or ignore in your query.

The `group_*` formulas use a sub-query to perform these custom aggregations.
If the sub-query is at a less detailed level than the original query, ThoughtSpot adds the result column to the result of original query.
When the sub-query is at a finer detail level than the original query, ThoughtSpot re-aggregates the formula's results to match the groupings of the original query.

To ensure that the level of aggregation of the sub-query is returned the sub-query grouping columns must be included in the search query and/or visualized chart columns.

To use the groups and filters, specify them using the `query_groups` and `query_filters` keywords, respectively.
You can also add or exclude groups or filters.

== Examples

For a search on `revenue monthly ship mode`, you can add a formula to calculate yearly revenue by ship mode:

----
group_aggregate(sum(revenue), {ship mode, year(commit date)}, {})
----

The same formula can also be written using `query_groups()` and `query_filters()` as following:

----
group_aggregate(sum(revenue), query_groups() - {commit date} + {year(commit date)}, {})
----

This is helpful to include the main query groups that are not known at formula creation time.
You can use `+/-` to modify the set of groups included from the query.

== Finer-grained group formula results

The flexibility of groupings for group formulas enables you to create a formula that generates a computed column that is finer or coarser than the search itself. Note that ThoughtSpot by default aggregates formula results to the level of detail defined in the search bar. To increase the level of detail in your results, you must add filters to your search as well as defining them in your formula.

For example, you can have a search that shows *total yearly sales* and a formula that computes total sales _for each month_ (a finer-grained calculation than the search).

In such cases, if an additional aggregation is specified by the formula, the results get _reaggregated_.

Reaggregation can be applied in either of these ways:

* You can add an aggregation keyword just before a formula column in a search.
For example, in this search we've added the keyword *min* just before our formula for `monthly_sales`:
+
*sum revenue yearly min monthly_sales*
+
where, the `monthly_sales` formula is written as:
+
----
   group_aggregate(sum(revenue), {start_of_month(date)}, {})
----

* You can create a separate formula, such as in this search for:
+
*sum revenue yearly min_monthly_sales*
+
where, the `min_monthly_sales` formula is written as:
+
----
min(monthly_sales)
----

If no aggregation is specified, then the search query  aggregates to the level of detailed defined in the search bar. In the following search:

*sum revenue yearly monthly_sales*

the original query is computed at a yearly grain instead of monthly.


== Reaggregation scenarios

Some scenarios require aggregation on an already aggregated result.

For example, computing minimum monthly sales per ship mode, requires two aggregations:

* the first aggregation of *sum* to compute total monthly sales per ship mode.
* the second aggregation of *min* to compute the minimum sale that happened for any given month for that ship mode.

An example of this is this search:

*ship mode min monthly_sales*

where the formula `monthly_sales` is written as:

----
group_aggregate(sum(revenue), query_groups() + {start_of_month(date)}, {})
----

== Groups and filters

Flexible group aggregate formulas allow for flexibility in both xref:formulas-aggregation-group.adoc#[groupings] and xref:formulas-aggregation-filtered.adoc#[filters].
The formulas give you the ability to specify only groupings or only filters.

[#query-filters]
== Query filters

With `+query_filters()+{filter_condition}+` or `+query_filters()-{filter_condition}+`, users will be able to aggregate the results while including/excluding a filter condition.

Filter condition: `Ship Mode='car'`

For a search on `Category Customer ID sales by customer id and category Ship Mode='car’`, you can add a formula to calculate sales by category for each customer as:

----
sales by Customer ID and Category= group_aggregate (sum(Sales), {Category, Customer ID }, query_filters()+{Ship Mode='air'})
----

In this case, the results will be aggregated based on the dimensions: `‘Category’` and `‘Customer ID’` and filters: `‘air’` and `‘car’`.

With `+query_filters()-{column}+`, users will be able to aggregate the results while removing any expression related to a column.

Filter condition: `Ship Mode='car'`

For a search on `Customer ID sales by customer id and category Ship Mode='car'`, you can add a formula to calculate sales for each customer while ignoring the filter on a column as:

----
sales by Customer ID and Category= group_aggregate (sum(Sales), {Customer ID, Category }, query_filters()-{Ship Mode})
----

In this case, the results will be aggregated based on the dimensions in the search;
Customer ID and any filter related to Ship Mode will not be considered while aggregating the results.
