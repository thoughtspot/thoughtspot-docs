:description: You can add a connection to a Mode database in ThoughtSpot Cloud, and perform live queries to create Answers and Liveboards.
:jira: SCAL-176923, SCAL-201296, SCAL-204494 (update from Florian)

For customers that use both {connection} and ThoughtSpot Cloud, the {connection} integration provides a way to expose data prepared using {connection}â€™s code-first data workflows to your business users in ThoughtSpot, or to your customers using ThoughtSpot Embedded. You can connect to a {connection} Workspace in ThoughtSpot Cloud as if it were a database, using {connection} Datasets as tables, and perform live queries against {connection} to create Answers and Liveboards.

Even if your Datasets in {connection} come from different sources (for example, one from a table in Snowflake and one from a Google Sheet), you can create joins across them in ThoughtSpot worksheets or models. This allows you to create visualizations and Liveboards that mash up data from multiple sources.


NOTE: {connection} connector is in Early Access and off by default. To enable it, contact your administrator.
