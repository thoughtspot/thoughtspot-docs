:description: Viewing the underlying data of your Answer gives you an un-aggregated view of the underlying data.


You can see the most granular details of a given result set, that is,
it shows the un-aggregated view.
This feature lets you understand what an Answer consists of.
For example, if you search for `customer region revenue`, the Answer shows the aggregate revenue value for each customer region.
Then, you can right-click any row and then select *Show underlying data*, to see each value which constitutes `revenue` for any given region.

Only the first 1,000 rows appear when viewing the underlying data.
You can even download the results shown when you choose *Show underlying data* from a chart.
The download file limit is a million rows.

NOTE: ThoughtSpot does not support showing underlying data for searches based on schemas with chasm traps.

To show underlying data:

. Right-click the visualization or table cell of interest.
. Select *Show underlying data*.
