:description: Learn about simple number calculations.

You can use simple number functions to perform useful percent calculations on your data.
Simple number functions include addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

[horizontal]
&#42;::
Multiplication; returns the result of multiplying two numbers.
+
`3 * 2 = 6`
+
`price * taxrate`

&#43;::
Addition; returns the result of adding two numbers.
+
`1 + 2 = 3`
+
`price + shipping`

&#45;::
Subtraction; returns the result of subtracting the second number from the first.
+
`3 - 2 = 1`
+
`revenue - tax`

&#47;::
Division; returns the result of dividing the first number by the second.
+
`6 / 3 = 2`
+
`markup / retail price`

== Calculate percentages

Calculating percentages is useful when you want to see, for example, the percentage of revenue that each retail department generates (gifts, bakery, canned goods, etc.).

Create a formula called `Percent Revenue` in the xref:formula-add.adoc[*Formula Assistant*]:

`( sum ( revenue ) / group_sum ( revenue ) ) * 100`

Replace `revenue` with your company's name for their `revenue` column, such as `revenue_dollar_amount`.

Now you can see the percentage of your total revenue that each department contributes, using the percent revenue formula that you just created.
See the following example.
