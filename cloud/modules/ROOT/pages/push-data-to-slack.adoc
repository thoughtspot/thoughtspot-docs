:description: You can connect ThoughtSpot to your Slack workspace and push insights to a Slack channel.

ThoughtSpot app actions allow you to connect to your Slack workspace and deliver insights directly to a Slack channel.

Before pushing data to your Slack workspace, perform the following checks:

* You have a Slack account.
* The xref:answer-experience-new.adoc[new answer experience] is enabled on your instance.
* The Slack app action is added to a visualization or saved answer on your instance.
+
A user with Developer or Administrator privileges can add an app action to a ThoughtSpot instance. If the app action is configured as a global action, the action will appear in the **More** menu image:icon-more-10px.png[the more options menu]. If the action is set as a local app action, you must add it to a saved answer or visualization by clicking *Add action* in the *Custom actions* panel. For more information, see https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/?pageid=add-action-viz[Add a local action to a visualization, window=_blank].

== Initiate a push request

To initiate a data push request to your Slack workspace, follow these steps:

. Go to a Liveboard visualization or saved answer page.

. If you have created an answer from a new query, make sure you save the answer.
+

. Select the *More* menu image:icon-more-10px.png[the more options menu], and click the *Send to Slack* action to initiate a data push request.

+
ThoughtSpot requests access to your Slack workspace and opens the app authorization page.

+
[NOTE]
====
The app authorization page opens as a pop-up, so make sure your web browser allows the pop-up.
====

. Specify your Slack workspace and click **Continue**.

+
The system prompts you to sign in to your workspace if you haven't already signed in. To continue with the integration, you can log in to your workspace.

. To authorize the request, click **Allow**.

+
This step is required only if you are using the Slack integration action for the first time or when ThoughtSpot refreshes its OAuth access token.


. Wait for ThoughtSpot to connect to your workspace and obtain a list of channels.

+
If the connection is successful, the app action dialog in the ThoughtSpot UI displays a list of Slack channels to which you can push data.

+

You can also search for a channel and then select it.

. If required, modify the title of the data.
. Add the text to send in your Slack message.
. Specify if the data must be sent as an image (PNG) file or in the CSV format, or both.
+

[NOTE]
====
If a chart or table does not include measures, the data will not be sent in the image format.
