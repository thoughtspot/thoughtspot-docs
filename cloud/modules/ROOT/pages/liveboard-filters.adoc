:description: You can apply filters to Liveboards as well as tables and charts.



include::partial$liveboard-experience-new-announcement.adoc[]

Filters, including bulk filters and exclude filters, can be applied to Liveboards just as with tables and charts.
These kinds of filters apply to an entire Liveboard, making it easy to see only the data that you are interested in across the tables and charts within a Liveboard.

== When to use a Liveboard filter

Liveboard filters can be very useful when you want to apply the same filters to more than one related visualization.
You can narrow the focus of your Liveboard for specific purposes or audiences.

When you apply a filter, the Liveboard is not automatically saved with your filter applied.
This is to encourage ad-hoc filtering.
Therefore, people with read-only access can create Liveboard filters and edit the values of pre-existing filters.
You must have edit access to the Liveboard, and view access (or higher) to the underlying data source in order to save a Liveboard filter.

Note that Liveboard filters only apply to the tables and charts that are based on worksheets.
If a Liveboard also includes tables and charts that were created from underlying tables, the filters don't apply to them.

To create one filter that filters visualizations based on multiple worksheets, you can link the worksheet columns, at the Liveboard level.
Refer to xref:liveboard-filters-linked.adoc[Linked Liveboard filters].

NOTE: Filters automatically apply to all tabs in the Liveboard. To specify certain tabs or visualizations that the filter should apply to, refer to xref:liveboard-filters-selective.adoc[].

== Create a Liveboard filter

You can create a filter in the Liveboard view for any Liveboard.
This allows you to easily manipulate the visualizations and view the modified presentation in one place.

Here is an example that shows you how to add a single filter to a Liveboard.
To create a Liveboard filter:

. Select the *Edit* button at the top right of the Liveboard. If this button is grayed out, you do not have edit privileges for the Liveboard. To resolve this, contact your administrator or the creator of the Liveboard.

. In the top menu bar that appears, select *Add filter*.

. In the populated columns menu, click the *Add filter* icon next to the column you would like to filter on.

. Under *Default values > Include*, select the values to include in your answer. The filter modal only shows 500 values; if the column you selected has more than 500 values, you must use the filter search bar to find the additional values.

. If you want to exclude values, click *Exclude* and choose values to exclude.

. Click *Apply*.

. To save the Liveboard with these filters, select *Save* in the top menu bar.

When you apply a filter, the Liveboard is not automatically saved with your filter applied to every object in the Liveboard that was created from a worksheet.
Liveboard filters do not apply to tables and charts built directly on top of base tables.

== Apply filters to specific visualizations or tabs

You can apply filters to only certain visualizations or tabs that you specify.
To specify the visualizations or tabs that a Liveboard filter should apply to, follow these steps, or refer to xref:liveboard-filters-selective.adoc[Selective Liveboard filters]:

. Select the *Edit* button at the top right of the Liveboard. If this button is grayed out, you do not have edit privileges for the Liveboard. To resolve this, contact your administrator or the creator of the Liveboard.

. In the top menu bar, select *Add filter*.
. In the *Add filters* side panel, you see a list of columns. Click the filter icon image:icon-filter-10px.png[] next to the column you would like to selectively filter on.
. Specify values to include or exclude, if you did not already specify them.
. Select *Applicable to* from the filters modal side menu.
You can select or unselect entire tabs, or only choose certain visualizations.
You can also search for a visualization.

. Select *Apply*.

== Linked filters
You can link columns from multiple worksheets, to create one Liveboard filter for visualizations that come from different worksheets.

To learn how to create linked filters, refer to xref:liveboard-filters-linked.adoc[].

== Edit a filter

Your applied filters appear in a row at the top of the Liveboard, where you can click on them to open the filter window. Depending on where you open the filter edit modal, you have different options.

If you open the filter modal from *View mode*, you can only edit the values to include or exclude.

If you open the filter from *Edit mode*, by selecting the *Edit* button at the top right of the Liveboard and clicking on the filter, you can edit the values to include or exclude, specify the visualizations the filter should apply to, and configure linked filters.

== Delete a filter
To delete a filter, you must be in *Edit mode*.

. Select the *More* menu icon image:icon-more-10px.png[more options menu icon] for the Liveboard, and select *Edit*.

. Hover over the filter, and select the *x* that appears.
