You can copy and paste the copied link to include in a presentation or spreadsheet, or email or Slack it to other people in your company.
Note that when clicking the link, the person must be authenticated to ThoughtSpot to see the visualization (e.g.

You can also use this link for embedding the chart or table in another Web page, Web portal, or application by using the xref:rest-api.adoc[Liveboard Data API].
