Your ThoughtSpot application may require periodic maintenance. You can always view upcoming scheduled maintenance from the Admin Console.

To view maintenance alerts, navigate to the Admin Console by clicking on the *Admin* tab from the top navigation bar. Select *Scheduled maintenance* from the side navigation bar that appears.

Before any planned maintenance, users see a yellow warning bar, letting them know about upcoming downtime for the application.

When ThoughtSpot is under maintenance, you are not able to use the application.
