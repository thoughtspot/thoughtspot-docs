[#reset]
== Reset configuration
You may want to reset a SpotApp that you configured earlier. This process allows you to reconfigure the SpotApp, but does *_not_* delete any worksheets, answers, and Liveboards that the first SpotApp generated. To reset the configuration, follow these steps:

. Navigate to *Data > SpotApps*.

. Select the SpotApp you would like to reset.

. On the right side of the screen, select *Reset configuration*.

. Select *Continue*. Note that this process does *_not_* delete the objects the SpotApp generated.
