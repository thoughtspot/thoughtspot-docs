You can comment on data points in a Liveboard to bring information to the attention of your teammates.

IMPORTANT: Commenting is disabled by default. To enable it, contact your ThoughtSpot administrator or open a ticket with {support-url}.

To add a comment to a Liveboard, click the *Comment* icon image:comment-icon.png[comment icon] to the left of the *More* menu icon image:icon-more-10px.png[Ellipsis icon].

All previous comments appear in the right sidebar. To move the sidebar, select the dot icon image:icon-dot.png[dot icon] and drag across the screen.

After clicking *Comment*, you can hover over the data point, heading, or description you'd like to comment on, and click it to begin typing your comment. You can tag other users using the @ symbol. Users tagged in a comment receive an email notification. When a new comment is added, a red dot appears on the comment icon to let users know there is an unread comment.

Users can reply to comments by clicking on the comment, and selecting the *Reply* section below the comment. You can also click the *more options* icon in the top right corner of any comment to share with Slack, unsubscribe from the thread, or resolve the original comment. To exit comment mode, press *ESC*, or click the x-icon in the top right corner of the comment sidebar.


Data in a Liveboard may change after you add a comment. ThoughtSpot stores the data point at the time you commented. To see the original data behind a comment, click on the data point below the comment.

If you filter data, modify a visualization, or delete a visualization on a Liveboard after commenting on it, the comment is classified as unattached, and is available for viewing in the comment sidebar.

== Limitations

Collaborative Liveboards have the following limitations:

- Liveboard comments do not support group-based separation. Any group with access to the Liveboard can see comments posted by any other group which has access to the Liveboard. A user in a cluster can tag any other user in the cluster in a comment.
- Liveboard comments are not supported in ThoughtSpot Embedded. When a Liveboard is embedded in another application, the comment icon is not visible to the embedded application users regardless of their access privileges.
