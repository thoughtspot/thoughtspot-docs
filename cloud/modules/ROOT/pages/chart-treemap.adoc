:description: The treemap chart displays hierarchical data as a set of nested rectangles.

Treemap charts use color and rectangle size to represent two measure values.
Each rectangle, or branch, is a value of the attribute.
Some branches can contain smaller rectangles, or sub-branches.
This setup makes it possible to display a large number of items in an efficient way.
