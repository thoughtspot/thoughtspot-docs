Learn how to configure OAuth in your Google Cloud project. In order to use the OAuth authentication type for a Google {connection} connection in ThoughtSpot, you must complete these steps. These steps are a representative example that serve as a guide to set up OAuth credentials in your Google Cloud project. For more information, refer to the official Google documentation links provided at the end of this article.

IMPORTANT: Each ThoughtSpot instance requires a unique {connection} security integration.
Each user in {connection} must have a default warehouse and default role.

The following sections describe how to <<configure-consent-screen,configure an OAuth consent screen>> and <<generate-credentials,generate OAuth credentials>>. If you've already configured an OAuth consent screen for another application in your project, you won't need to create another; you configure only one consent screen for all applications in a project.

NOTE: For more information about configuring the Google OAuth consent screen, see the link:https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6158849#userconsent&zippy=%2Cuser-consent[Google Support documentation].

.. For *Name*, enter a name for the app, such as ConnectionsOAuth.

.. The *Authorized Javascript origins* section is optional, unless you are redirecting using javascript.

.. For *Authorized redirect URIS*, click *+ ADD URI* to display the *URIs 1* field. For *URIs 1*, enter the URL to your ThoughtSpot instance, followed by `/callosum/v1/connection/generateTokens`. +
For example, +
`\https://thoughtspot.cloud/callosum/v1/connection/generateTokens`.
+

. Copy your client ID and your client secret values. You will need them to configure OAuth for the {connection} connection in ThoughtSpot.

== Logging in to a connection created by another user using OAuth

As an admin user, you may run into an issue logging in to connections created using OAuth. To resolve this issue, complete the following steps:

. Search on a table belonging to the connection you are trying to edit. The following error appears:
+
image:oauth-error.png[Error reading “Error in loading data. Connection to Snowflake could not be established. OAuth login required. Login”]

. Click *Login*. You will be directed to the IDP login page.

. Enter your login credentials.

. You will now have access to edit the connection.
