What's new::
View short summaries for each new feature in the release your cluster is running. This pop-up appears when you first sign in to ThoughtSpot after an upgrade to a new release. You can revisit the pop-up here.

Get Help::

The Information Center, and many other ThoughtSpot guides, are delivered through Pendo.
Pendo is ThoughtSpot's system for delivery of in-product tips, short videos, and other training elements.
Your firewall may automatically block Pendo.
