:description: Easily add notes to your Liveboard so that viewers of your Liveboard can quickly understand its value and how to use it.

Add notes to your Liveboards, so that viewers of your Liveboards can quickly understand how to use the data and visualizations you gathered.

Note tiles can provide an overview of a Liveboard or visualization, company branding through images, definitions of terms used in the Liveboard, descriptions of how to best use the data in the Liveboard or visualization, and so on. You can add note tiles anywhere in the Liveboard, unlike the Liveboard description, which is only at the top of the Liveboard. For example, if you have a visualization far down in the Liveboard that needs images and a long description to be best understood, use a note tile.
