Use the User Adoption Liveboard to understand how your users are interacting with ThoughtSpot, and how your user adoption changes over time. You must have admin privileges to view this Liveboard.

The User Adoption Liveboard contains essential information about your ThoughtSpot users and their adoption of the platform.
Use this Liveboard to understand weekly active users, inactive users, top 10 ad hoc searchers, popular Liveboards, and so on.

"Active user" refers to any user who has completed a user action, such as saving an Answer or opening a Liveboard, at least once within a certain time frame. Any action that requires a backend API call is captured within the User Adoption Liveboard's underlying Worksheet. If a user logs in to ThoughtSpot but does not perform any action, they are not included in the "active user" count.


NOTE: If your organization uses xref:orgs-overview.adoc[multi-tenancy with Orgs], you must be a cluster administrator to view the User Adoption Liveboard, not an Org administrator.

Users with admin privileges can share system Liveboards, such as the User Adoption Liveboard, with other users who do not have admin privileges. However, be aware that you may be sharing sensitive user-level information, such as the names of objects that a user accessed.

To view this Liveboard, navigate to the *Admin Console* by selecting *Admin* from the top navigation bar.
Select *User adoption* from the side navigation bar.

If your organization uses xref:orgs-overview.adoc[multi-tenancy with Orgs], ensure that you are in the Primary Org, in the *All orgs* section of the Admin Console.

Alternatively, search for the Liveboard in the *Search Answers and Liveboards* search bar.

== Use the Liveboard

You can filter the Liveboard by user from the filter bar underneath the Liveboard name.

Use this Liveboard to view and analyze information about the following topics:

* hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly active users (DAU Last 4 Weeks, WAU Last 4 Weeks, MAU Last 4 Weeks, Weekly Active Users, Daily Active Users, Hourly Active Users)
* number of user actions on the Liveboards and Answers in the cluster (Count of Current Liveboards, Count of Current Answers)
* which users are most active in ThoughtSpot, and what they do (ThoughtSpot Champions Last 30 Days, Top 10 Liveboard Consumers Last 30 days, Top 10 Adhoc Searchers)
* popular Liveboards (Popular Liveboards Last 30 Days, Top 10 Liveboards Ratio by Views, Top 10 Liveboards Ratio by Users)
* user actions in the last month (User Actions Last 4 Weeks)
* unused Answers and Liveboards (Abandoned Answers, Abandoned Liveboards)
* inactive users (Inactive Users KPI chart and table)
* users by last login, number of Liveboard interactions, number of Search interactions, and number of days logged in during the last 6 months (User Profile)

== Best practices

The User Adoption Liveboard contains valuable information you can use to monitor and manage user consumption of the ThoughtSpot product. Follow these best practices when interacting with this Liveboard:

* Share the User Adoption Liveboard with other ThoughtSpot champions and executive buyers in your organization. To share the Liveboard, you must search for the Liveboard from the *Liveboards* page or from the Home page. You can't share it from the Admin Console.
** Consider creating a dedicated xref:group-management.adoc[group] for your data leaders or champions, so you can easily share insights, such as this Liveboard, that help your teams drive adoption.
* Spot usage trends, such as the number of users, the amount of activity, and the number and types of objects accessed over time. Use the *Weekly Active Users*, *Daily Active Users*, *Hourly Active Users*, and *Popular Pinboards Last 30 Days* visualizations.
* Understand which actions in ThoughtSpot are most popular, using the *User Actions Last 4 Weeks*, *Weekly User Action Group Ratio*, and *Weekly User Action Group* visualizations.
* Object management: view the *Abandoned Answers* and *Abandoned Pinboards* visualizations, and clean up unnecessary or unused objects.
