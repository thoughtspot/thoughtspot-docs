:description: You can share a connection to allow users to edit tables included in a connection.
:jira: SCAL-193815

Users with *can manage data* or *admin* privileges can now share connections with other users or groups that have *can manage data* privileges. Once granted access to a connection, users can add, remove, and modify tables in that connection.

If you explicitly unshare a table belonging to the shared connection with a user or group who has access to that connection, that user or group loses access to the connection. They can no longer add or remove tables from the connection, or create custom SQL views.

To share a connection, follow these steps:

. Navigate to the *Data* tab and select *Connections* from the left menu.

. Select the name of your connection from the list of connections.

. Click *Share connection*.

. Select *Done*.

NOTE: To remove access to a shared connection, open the *Share connection* pop-up and select *Remove access* to the left of the user or group name.
