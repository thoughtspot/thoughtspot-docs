ThoughtSpot supports {connection}'s internal OAuth for a {connection} connection.
With OAuth, each ThoughtSpot user authenticates with {connection} and authorizes ThoughtSpot to query the database using their {connection} user account.

For {connection} connections that use internal OAuth, users must log in when their OAuth tokens expire.
The amount of time that {connection} OAuth tokens are valid is set in {connection}.

== Configuring a {connection} database for internal OAuth with ThoughtSpot

To add a {connection} connection to ThoughtSpot using internal OAuth, you must set up the OAuth integration in {connection}.
This requires a {connection} user account with ACCOUNTADMIN permission.

IMPORTANT: Each ThoughtSpot instance requires a unique {connection} security integration.
Each user in {connection} must have a default warehouse and default role.

In your {connection} database, do the following:

. In the worksheet view, enter the following commands, and click *Run*:
+
----
SHOW USERS;

SHOW SECURITY INTEGRATIONS;

CREATE OR REPLACE SECURITY INTEGRATION <enter a name for your security role>
  TYPE = OAUTH
  OAUTH_CLIENT = CUSTOM
  OAUTH_CLIENT_TYPE = <enter a client type>
  OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI = 'https://<public url of your ThoughtSpot instance>/callosum/v1/connection/generateTokens'
  OAUTH_USE_SECONDARY_ROLES = IMPLICIT
  ENABLED = TRUE
  COMMENT = '<enter a description of your security profile>'
----

. At the bottom of what you entered in step 1, add an empty line, and then enter the following to describe your security integration:
+
----
DESCRIBE SECURITY INTEGRATION <enter description of your security integration>;

SELECT SYSTEM$SHOW_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRETS('<enter same description of your security integration as previous line');
----
+
Example of a full query:
+
----
SHOW USERS;

SHOW SECURITY INTEGRATIONS;

CREATE OR REPLACE SECURITY INTEGRATION OAUTH_CONFIG
  TYPE = OAUTH
  OAUTH_CLIENT = CUSTOM
  OAUTH_CLIENT_TYPE = 'CONFIDENTIAL'
  OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI = 'https://177.122.45.2/callosum/v1/connection/generateTokens'
  OAUTH_USE_SECONDARY_ROLES = IMPLICIT
  ENABLED = TRUE
  COMMENT = 'Profile for passthrough'

DESCRIBE SECURITY INTEGRATION OAUTH_CONFIG;

SELECT SYSTEM$SHOW_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRETS('OAUTH_CONFIG');
----

. Click the *Run* button to run the full query.
+
The Details window appears displaying a JSON object.

. Copy the JSON object and click *Done* to close the window.
. Paste the contents into a text editor.
+
Example:
+
----
{"OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET_2":"KqKBu0xOxPtmk+RKvNP0+eIAMlFxMsu8rRh6s5q1qLY",
"OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET":"KdKBb0aOxPzml+RJvMP1/eIEMlFxM/su6rPh2wLZ",
"OAUTH_CLIENT_ID":"aOxPzmlRJvCP5eIUMlFxMbu6rJh7mTO="}
----

. For OAUTH_CLIENT_ID, copy the information between quotes after the colon (:).
+
Example: `aOxPzmlRJvCP5eIUMlFxMbu6rJh7mTO=`
+
NOTE: Make sure you include the equals sign (=), if it exists.

. In the {connection} connection details page in ThoughtSpot, paste the OAuth client ID in the *OAuth Client ID* field.
. For OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET, copy the information between quotes after the colon (:).
+
Example: `KdKBb0aOxPzml+RJvMP1/eIEMlFxM/su6rPh2wLZ`

. In the {connection} connection details page in ThoughtSpot, paste the OAuth client ID in the *OAuth Client Secret* field.
+
NOTE: Once a connection is created the token associated with the user login credentials for the connection is stored in ThoughtSpot for 90 days.

== Sharing a worksheet built from tables in a {connection} connection that uses OAuth

When you share a ThoughtSpot object (worksheet, Liveboard, or answer) that references a {connection} connection that uses OAuth authentication, the user is prompted to log in to {connection} before they can view any data.
When viewing the Liveboard, answer, or running a search on the worksheet, ThoughtSpot displays a message telling the user to log in with a button to initiate the login process.

IMPORTANT: In order for a user to access your shared worksheet, they must have a default role assigned to their user in {connection}.
