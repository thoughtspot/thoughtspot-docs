:description: Starting a new ThoughtSpot search is simple, like starting a new Google search.

You can start a new search from any page in ThoughtSpot by clicking the *Search data* button in the top navigation bar.

NOTE: As part of the new Data Fluency features in the 9.2.0.cl release, you can use a new and improved way to search. If this beta feature is enabled on your ThoughtSpot cluster, see <<search-data-fluency, Starting a new search with Data Fluency>> for details.

== Starting a new search

To start a new search:

. Select the *Search data* button from the top navigation bar.
+
The *Search data* page appears.

. Choose your sources by selecting *Add sources*.
If you already have sources in the *Data* panel, select the *Choose sources* icon image:icon-analyze-custom-10px.png[Choose sources wrench icon].
 .. Filter through all available sources by using the search bar or tags.
 .. Select your sources.
 .. Select *Done*.
. Add columns to the search bar by typing in the search bar, or by double-clicking columns in the *Data* panel.
+
The columns listed in the left panel are grouped together by data sources for discoverability and ease of access.
You can also add multiple columns by clicking each column to select it, and then clicking *+ Add Columns*.

. Select *Enter* on your keyboard or select *Go* to the right of the search bar.
As you add items to or remove them from the search bar, press *Enter* or *Go* to ensure that ThoughtSpot updates your search.

ThoughtSpot gives your search an automatic title based on your search columns, and displays it as either a table or chart, depending on how it is best represented.
