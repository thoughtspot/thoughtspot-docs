. Choose your sources by clicking *Add sources*.
If you already have sources in the *Data* panel, select the *Choose sources* icon image:icon-analyze-custom-10px.png[Choose sources wrench icon].
 .. Filter through all available sources by using the search bar or tags.
 .. Select your sources.
 .. Select *Done*.
. Add columns to the search bar by typing in the search bar, or by double clicking columns in the *Data* panel.

The columns listed in the left panel are grouped together by data sources for discoverability and ease of access.
You can also add multiple columns by clicking each column to select it, and then clicking *+ Add Columns*.

. Click *Enter* on your keyboard or select *Go* to the right of the search bar.
As you add items to or remove them from the search bar, press *Enter* or *Go* to ensure that ThoughtSpot updates your search.

ThoughtSpot gives your search an automatic title based on your search columns, and displays it as either a table or chart, depending on how it is best represented.
