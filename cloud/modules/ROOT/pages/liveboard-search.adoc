You can perform many of the same search actions on individual visualizations within a Liveboard as you can within a search.
You can interact directly with a visualization of a Liveboard to perform ad hoc searches or edit it.
These search actions include the following:

* Editing a search - You can edit the original search and reconfigure the answer.
Click the three-dot *Actions* button to the upper-right of your visualization and select *Edit*.
