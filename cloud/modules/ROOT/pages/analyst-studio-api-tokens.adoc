== Workspace tokens

Workspace API tokens are meant to be used for programmatic management, such as archiving inactive Reports or deleting schedules for stale Reports across your Workspace. These tokens mimic admin access to the Workspace and only admin users will be able to create and manage them.

To generate a new Workspace API token, you must be on a paid plan and an admin of your Workspace. Navigate to **Workspace Settings > Features > API Keys > Workspace keys**. Click "Create API Key" and you will be prompted to add a display name and save the token. Ensure you save the credentials securely.


== Member tokens

Member API tokens are meant to be used by a single user for individual use cases, such as updating a specific Report or managing a Collection. These tokens mimic the individual user's access to the resources in the Workspace.
To enable the Member API tokens feature, admins can navigate to your **Workspace Settings > Features > API Keys > Member keys**. Admins can see all the Member tokens created and revoke all or specific tokens on this tab. Users can then go to **Workspace Settings > Personal > My API Keys** to create their own API tokens.


WARNING: Remember to store your API token and password securely. Do not expose the password on public sites, in client-side code, or in public code repositories.

The credentials are comprised of two parts:
1. **Token**:  The public component of the credential. Often referred to as the username or access key during authentication.
2. **Secret**:  The private component of the credential. Often referred to as the password or access secret during authentication. This is only shown once when creating the token and must be saved somewhere secure before closing the modal.

Workspace and Member API tokens are set to expire after 90 days by default. To revoke all tokens, select "Revoke all tokensâ€¦" and confirm the action, or hover to revoke a single token.

Admins will be able to see the following for all active, revoked and expired API tokens already generated:

- Who the token was created by
- When the token was last used
- When the token is set to expire

* Granular permissions are not currently supported with the Workspace API tokens;
they allow admin access to the Workspace for now.
