You can now create custom groups, which can be used to classify values in a list you can then reuse across multiple analyses. Unless defined on a Worksheet, formulas and parameters are generally available only when in use on an Answer, and must be remade if you navigate away from the Answer without saving. Custom groups are community objects which remain when you navigate away from the Search Data page and can be viewed by any user with view access to the underlying Worksheet.

NOTE: Custom groups are in early access and off by default. The early access version of custom groups is focused on query generation and reusability. To enable this feature, contact {support-url}.

To create a custom group, first define the business question you wish to answer. For example, you may have a data set containing the complete list of products available from a certain chain of stores. You may want to find out which products are most popular, and define them by sales volume as “gold”, “silver”, or “bronze” level products. To create a column showcasing this defined list of values, follow these steps:

. Navigate to the *Search Data* page by clicking the *Search data* button in the top navigation bar.

. Ensure you are searching on the correct Worksheet, and select the *Product* column from the left side bar, or type the word into the Search bar. To see the quantity purchased by product, select *Quantity purchased* and click the *Go* button or press *Enter*.

. Create a formula, named Quantity Purchased Range, to define ranges of quantities purchased as Gold, Silver, or Bronze. You can define it as `if ( sum(quantity purchased) > 80000) then 'gold' else if (sum(quantity purchased) > 60000) then 'silver' else 'bronze'`.

. Click *Save*. Check the table that appears to make sure the results are as expected.

. Simplify the search to show only the *Product* column.

. From the *more options* menu image:icon-more-10px.png[more options icon], select *Save as custom group*.

. In the *Save custom group* window, fill out the following fields:
.. Name: Name your custom group something meaningful.
.. Description: Describe what this custom group represents.
.. Anchor column: Select the column you are using as the base of your list of values. In this example, *Products*.
.. Return column: For some use cases, you will want to select the same column as the anchor column. In this case, select the definition you want the column to return, based on the criteria you defined in the formula. In this example, *Quantity Purchased Range*.
.. Default group for all other values: This option is only necessary if you used a filter on the anchor column to take out unwanted values. In this example there are no unwanted values, so you can leave it blank.

. Click *Save*.
