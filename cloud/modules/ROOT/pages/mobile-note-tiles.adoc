[#mobile-note-tiles,Note tiles]

You can now view note tiles in Liveboards using the ThoughtSpot mobile app.

Notes are added to Liveboards, so that viewers of the Liveboards can quickly understand how to use the data and visualizations.

Note tiles can provide an overview of a Liveboard or visualization, company branding through images, definitions of terms used in the Liveboard, descriptions of how to best use the data in the Liveboard or visualization, and so on. Note tiles can appear anywhere in the Liveboard, unlike the Liveboard description, which is only at the top of the Liveboard.
