ThoughtSpot has robust local authentication, and integrates with SAML.

Local authentication is enabled by default in your ThoughtSpot Cloud environment.
This means that any local user you xref:admin-portal-users.adoc[create] can sign in to ThoughtSpot with the specific ThoughtSpot credentials you set up for them when creating the user.

NOTE: If your organization uses xref:orgs-overview.adoc[multi-tenancy with Orgs], you must be a cluster administrator to manage local authentication, not an Org administrator. You manage local authentication for the whole cluster. You cannot set it separately for each Org.

If you disable local authentication, no local user can sign in to ThoughtSpot.

You can enable or disable local authentication from the Admin Console.

Navigate to the Admin Console by selecting the *Admin* tab from the top navigation bar.
Select *Local* from the side navigation bar that appears.

If your organization uses xref:orgs-overview.adoc[multi-tenancy with Orgs], ensure that you are in the Primary Org, in the *All orgs* section of the Admin Console. You manage local authentication for the whole cluster. You cannot set it separately for each Org.

Select the *Edit* button in the top middle of the screen.

Choose *Enable* or *Disable*, and select *OK*.

Note that you cannot disable local authentication until you configure xref:authentication-integration.adoc[SAML authentication].
