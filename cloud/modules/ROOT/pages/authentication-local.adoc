ThoughtSpot has robust local authentication, and integrates with SAML.

Local authentication is enabled by default in your ThoughtSpot Cloud environment.
This means that any local user you xref:admin-portal-users.adoc[create] can sign in to ThoughtSpot with the specific ThoughtSpot credentials you set up for them when creating the user.

If you disable local authentication, no local user can sign in to ThoughtSpot.

You can enable or disable local authentication from the Admin Console.

Navigate to the Admin Console by selecting the *Admin* tab from the top navigation bar.
Select *Local* from the side navigation bar that appears.

If your organization uses xref:orgs-overview.adoc[multi-tenancy with Orgs], ensure that you are in the Org that you want to configure, in the *All orgs* section of the Admin Console.

Select the *Edit* button in the top middle of the screen.

Choose *Enable* or *Disable*, and select *OK*.

Note that you cannot disable local authentication until you configure xref:authentication-integration.adoc[SAML authentication].

.SAML and Local authentication at the Org level [.badge.badge-beta]#Beta#
****
If your organization uses xref:orgs-overview.adoc[multi-tenancy with Orgs] with SAML using IAMv2, ThoughtSpot allows customers to enable or disable local authentication at the Org and cluster levels.

To enable local authentication at the Org level, contact {support-url}. Org level settings override cluster level settings.

To disable local authentication on a cluster or Org, at least one SAML or OIDC connection must be active. The *Local* tab is found under *Authentication* in the *Admin* portal. It is only present in Orgs with the *SAML/SSO* tab under *Authentication*. If only one active SSO connection is configured, and local authentication is disabled, you can't delete the SSO connection because users will have no way to log in to the application.

By default, local authentication is enabled for new Orgs. Local authentication is also visible in the *All Orgs* section. With per-Org URLs configured, disabling local authentication only disables it for the specific Org's URL.
