ThoughtSpot has robust local authentication, and integrates with SAML.

Local authentication is enabled by default in your ThoughtSpot Cloud environment.
This means that any local user you xref:admin-portal-users.adoc[create] can sign in to ThoughtSpot with the specific ThoughtSpot credentials you set up for them when creating the user.

If you disable local authentication, no local user can log into ThoughtSpot.

You can enable or disable local authentication from the Admin Console.

Navigate to the Admin Console by clicking on the *Admin* tab from the top navigation bar.
Select *Local* from the side navigation bar that appears.

Note that you cannot disable local authentication until you configure xref:authentication-integration.adoc[SAML authentication].
