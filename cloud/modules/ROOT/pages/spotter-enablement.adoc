//AI Answers on Liveboards:: Also known as Ask Sage, this feature enables you to use natural language to ask follow-up questions about answers pinned to your Liveboards. For more information, see xref:ask-sage.adoc[].

//AI Synonyms:: This feature automatically creates synonyms to your Model column names when you save a new or edited Model. For more information, see xref:data-modeling-visibility.adoc#automatic-synonyms[AI-generated synonyms].

//AI Model Descriptions:: This feature automatically creates descriptions in natural language for Models you create or edit, generating when you click *Save*.

AI Narratives for SpotIQ:: Also known as AI Highlights, this feature provides you with quick insights on how top metrics changed in your Liveboard. For more information, see xref:liveboard-ai-highlights.adoc[].

. From the *LLM Configuration* section, you can choose which provider to use for ThoughtSpot's AI features. We currently support Azure OpenAI, and Google Gemini (Early Access).

. From the *Data Models* section, you can disable AI search on all data models. To enable AI on a data model, you need to access them from the Data workspace and turn it on individually.

. From the *User privileges* section, you can click to be directed to Users and Groups in order to assign privileges.

. To revert to the previous settings, click *Reset configuration*.

== Data shared with LLM


The Answer Why questions feature is the only setting that shares data with the underlying LLM.

Enabling this feature allows Spotter to send query-related data, such as aggregated metrics and dimension values, to an LLM to identify the data points and generate explanations. Please ensure this complies with your organizationâ€™s policies. The data is not utilized for model training, and we maintain a zero-data retention policy with all our LLM providers.
