:description: As long as you have permissions to edit a worksheet, you can always go into it and set a different join or RLS rule.

If you find that the charts and tables built on a worksheet contain a large number of null values (which display as `+{blank}+` in the web browser), you can fix this by changing the xref:join-worksheet-edit.adoc#[internal joins] for the worksheet.

If you have the *Can administer ThoughtSpot* privilege or the *Can manage data* plus edit privilege on a worksheet, you can edit the worksheet and change its RLS or other key settings.

* xref:join-worksheet-edit.adoc#[internal worksheet joins]
