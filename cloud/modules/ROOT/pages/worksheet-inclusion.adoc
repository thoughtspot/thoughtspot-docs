:description: As long as you have permissions to edit a Worksheet, you can always go into it and set a different join or RLS rule.

If you find that the charts and tables built on a Worksheet contain a large number of null values (which display as `+{blank}+` in the web browser), you can fix this by changing the xref:join-worksheet-edit.adoc#[internal joins] for the Worksheet.

If you have the *Can administer ThoughtSpot* privilege or the *Can manage data* plus edit privilege on a Worksheet, you can edit the Worksheet and change its RLS or other key settings.

== Change/configure a Worksheet

Before working through this procedure, make sure you are familiar with how the following affect data:

* xref:join-worksheet-edit.adoc#[internal Worksheet joins]
* xref:worksheet-progressive-joins.adoc#[Worksheet join rule]
* xref:security-rls-implement.adoc#[row-level security (RLS)]

To configure these values for a Worksheet:

. Select *Data* on the top navigation bar and then on *Worksheets*.
. Select the name of the Worksheet you want to edit from the list.
. Select the *Edit Worksheet* button in the upper-right side of the screen.
. Select the *+ icon* next to *Sources*.
. Scroll to the bottom of the page.
. Configure the Worksheet join rule and RLS setting as needed. Select *Apply joins progressively* or *Apply all joins*, and choose whether to *Disable row level security* for the Worksheet.
