:description: To provide richer insights, you can add a formula to your ThoughtSpot search.



The Formula Builder includes many types of operators, such as logical (if, then, else), math, date, and text string functions.

You can create a formula from directly within a search.
If you have the privilege that allows you to create or edit Worksheets, you can also create a formula within a Worksheet.
Formulas in Worksheets act as derived columns, so that anyone who uses the Worksheet as a data source will see the formula as just another column.

Adding a formula within a search works much the same way as adding a formula to a Worksheet.
However, you will be able to edit the formula directly from within the Answer.
If you add the Answer to a Liveboard and share it with the *Edit* privilege, other people can see the formula results, too.
To make edits to the formula, they also need to have the *Edit* privilege on the underlying data.

* *xref:formula-add.adoc[Add a formula to a search]* +
 You can add a formula directly within a search.
Some common reasons for using a formula in a search are to perform mathematical functions, check for and replace null values, or add if...then...else logic.
* *xref:formula-answer-edit.adoc[View or edit a formula in a search]* +
You can always go back and view or edit a formula that has been added to a search.
Do this by selecting the edit icon next to its name in the *Columns* listing.
* *xref:formulas-aggregation.adoc[About aggregate formulas]* +
When working with formulas, it is useful to understand the difference between regular (or row-wise) formulas and aggregation formulas.
* *xref:formulas-conversion.adoc[About conversion formulas]* +
Some formulas require the input to be of a particular data type.
If you find that you want to pass a value to the function, but it is of the wrong data type, you can convert it using a conversion formula.
* *xref:formulas-date.adoc[About date formulas]* +
 Date formulas allow you to apply date related functions to your formulas.
* *xref:formulas-simple-operations.adoc[About percent (simple number) calculations]* +
 You can use simple number functions to perform useful percent calculations.
* *xref:formulas-logical-operations.adoc[About conditional formulas (operators)]* +
 Conditional formulas, or operators, allow you to apply `if`/`then`/`else` conditions in your formulas.
* *xref:formulas-nested.adoc[About nested formulas]* +
 Nested formulas, or formula on formula, allow you to reference a formula within another formula.
* *xref:formulas-chasm-trap.adoc[About formula support for chasm trap schemas]* +
 You can create a formula that involves aggregated measures coming from multiple fact tables of a chasm trap.

Text formulas are also available.
These are covered in the comprehensive *xref:formula-reference.adoc[Formula function reference]*, which provides brief descriptions and examples for all types of formulas.
The articles in the list explain concepts and give step-by-step instructions of how to work with formulas, whereas the reference is a quick cheat sheet.
