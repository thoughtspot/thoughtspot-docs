Business users view data insights to inform and support critical business decisions.

You choose your persona, based on how you use ThoughtSpot.
As a _business user_, you use ThoughtSpot to search and analyze data to help inform your business decisions.
When you select the _business user_ persona, the business user onboarding begins, and guides you through a few basic scenarios.
