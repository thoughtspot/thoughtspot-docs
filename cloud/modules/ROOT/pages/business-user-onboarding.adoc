Business users view data insights to inform and support critical business decisions.

When you begin using ThoughtSpot, the onboarding process starts automatically.

You may see the following screen, allowing you to choose your persona, based on how you use ThoughtSpot. You see this screen if you have *Can administer ThoughtSpot* or *Can manage data* xref:privileges-end-user.adoc[privileges]. If you do not have these privileges, you do not see this screen, and instead start with the video on the *Welcome to ThoughtSpot* screen.

As a _business user_, you use ThoughtSpot to search and analyze data to help inform your business decisions.
When you select the _business user_ persona, the business user onboarding begins.

First, you watch a short video introduction to ThoughtSpot. Then, ThoughtSpot guides you through several sample searches with xref:search-assist.adoc[Search Assist]. You can select *Go to homepage* at any time during the Search Assist process. After you complete the first sample search, you can either select *Go to homepage* to exit the onboarding process, or *Try another search* to continue practicing with Search Assist.

To repeat user onboarding or change your persona, simply select *Profile* from the user icon at the top right of the page, and under menu:Preferences[New user onboarding], click *Revisit Onboarding*.

Here is a quick introduction to what you need to leverage ThoughtSpot as a business user:
