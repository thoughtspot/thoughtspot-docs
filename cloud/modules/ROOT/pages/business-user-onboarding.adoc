Business users view data insights to inform and support critical business decisions.

When you begin using ThoughtSpot, the onboarding process starts automatically.

You may see the following screen, allowing you to choose your persona, based on how you use ThoughtSpot. You see this screen if you have *Can administer ThoughtSpot* or *Can manage data* xref:privileges-end-user.adoc[privileges]. If you do not have these privileges, you do not see this screen, and instead start with the video on the *Get started* screen.

As a _business user_, you use ThoughtSpot to search and analyze data to help inform your business decisions.
When you select the _business user_ persona, the business user onboarding begins, and guides you through a few basic scenarios.

You can select *exit to homepage* at any time during the onboarding.

To repeat user onboarding or change your persona, simply select *Profile* from the user icon at the top right of the page, and under menu:Preferences[New user onboarding], click *Revisit Onboarding*.
