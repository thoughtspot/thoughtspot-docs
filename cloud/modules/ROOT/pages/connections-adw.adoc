You can easily add a connection to an Oracle database, enabling you to run live queries of an external database, create Answers and Liveboards.

NOTE: Starting with the 8.3.0.cl release, the *Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse* (ADW) connection type has changed to *Oracle*. With this change you can now select one of two types of Oracle data warehouses: Cloud or On Premise. Existing Oracle ADW connections are considered Cloud.
