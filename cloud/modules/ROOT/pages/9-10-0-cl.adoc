=== For the Business User




// Naomi -- scal-169683, documentation JIRA scal-201035
[#null-and]
Null and missing values in charts::
You can now choose how null and missing values appear in line, column, and bar charts in ThoughtSpot. Null and missing values appear as bars of 1 pixel width on bar and column charts. You can choose whether to display null date values as zero values, line breaks, or an average of proximate values on a line chart. Rather than showing a sharp decline to zero every time there is null or missing data on your line chart, you can see the missing values represented as line breaks or averages of the closest values instead. For more information, see
xref:chart-null-missing.adoc[Null and missing values in charts].

Ask Sage:: You can now conversationally search ThoughtSpot using natural language, asking follow-up questions for further clarification or to take your analysis in a new direction. To access Ask Sage, ask a question using the Natural Language Search interface on the Home page, and click *Ask a follow up*. For more information, see xref:ask-sage.adoc[Ask Sage].

[#interative-change]
Iterative change analysis [.badge.badge-beta-relnotes]#Beta#::
You can now drill down on specific columns in change analysis, in order to identify change drivers within your data.

For more information, see xref:spotiq-change.adoc#iterative[Iterative change analysis].

// Naomi -- SCAL-127727, documentation jira scal-201033
[#contextual-alert]

[#run-change]
Run change analysis iteratively:: You can now drill down on specific columns in change analysis, in order to identify change drivers within your data.

For more information, see xref:spotiq-change.adoc#iterative[Iterative change analysis].

// Naomi -- scal-147558, scal-201036
[#change-analysis]
Change analysis: remember personalized columns [.badge.badge-early-access-relnotes]#Early Access#::
Users with edit permissions on a Liveboard can set their preferred attribute columns through the change analysis window and select *Apply to all users* to keep those selections for any subsequent change analysis calculations on that Liveboard. Individual users can still override these preferences for their own calculations. For more information, see xref:spotiq-change.adoc#remember-personalized[Remember personalized columns].



// Naomi -- scal-156247, documentation JIRA scal-201037
[#natural-language]

// Naomi -- scal-177253, documentation JIRA scal-201038

[#roles-and]
Roles and more granular access privileges:: ThoughtSpot introduces role-based access control (RBAC) to allow for more granular access privileges. Use roles to apply privileges customized for your organizational needs.
ThoughtSpot includes some standard roles to help existing customers transition to RBAC. RBAC is supported in Primary Orgs. To enable RBAC, contact {support-url}. For more information, see xref:rbac.adoc[Understand RBAC and privileges].

[#mobile-enhancements]
Mobile enhancements:: We made the following improvements to ThoughtSpot mobile:

* We simplified the sign in process for the ThoughtSpot mobile app. You can now enter your company email to receive an email with a magic link login, rather than entering the server URL.
* ThoughtSpot now supports IAMv2 login.
* You can now change your ThoughtSpot locale through the Mobile app. When your locale is updated, ThoughtSpot translates labels, date formats and number formats to match the default for your country and language.
* You can now use SpotIQ analysis to directly identify the key drivers for recent change in your KPIs in ThoughtSpot Mobile. KPI change analysis allows you to drill down into the causes of change in your KPIs and customize the insights generated by SpotIQ.
To access this feature, go to your KPI chart and select the caret icon to the right of the percent change label. The *Run change analysis* pop-up allows you to customize the columns ThoughtSpot analyzes. Note that ThoughtSpot runs change analysis between the two most recent data points defined by the KPI’s time bucket (for example, `daily` or `weekly`).
* We introduced improved deep linking to ThoughtSpot mobile. When you click a link you no longer need to choose whether you want to view the link in your default mobile browser or the ThoughtSpot app. The default behavior is to open the link in ThoughtSpot if it is supported.
* You can now receive ThoughtSpot mobile push notifications. Receive push notifications when a Liveboard or Answer is shared with you. Monitor scheduled and threshold alerts with push notifications.
