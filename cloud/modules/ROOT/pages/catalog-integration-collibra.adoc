:description: Use ThoughtSpot’s connection to Collibra to import column- and table-level metadata and surface the data in the Search data knowledge cards.
:jira: SCAL-174136, SCAL-201297, SCAL-205044

Use ThoughtSpot’s connection to Collibra to import column- and table-level metadata from Collibra, including column description, table description, column certificate status and table certificate status, and surface the data in the Search data knowledge cards.

NOTE: Collibra catalog integration is in beta and off by default. To enable this feature, contact {support-url}. This catalog integration is only supported on AWS clusters.

To set up or edit a connection to Collibra, you must have *can manage catalog* permission. Once the metadata is imported, all users can see the metadata. Note, the user setting up the catalog connection can also configure which fields they want to display or hide on the column and table level knowledge cards in the Information panel display section. By default, all selected fields in the catalog connection process will be visible.

NOTE: You can only create a connection to a single data catalog at a time. If you connect to Collibra, for example, you cannot simultaneously connect to Alation.

== Prerequisites

To create a connection to Collibra, you will need the following information:

* API token
* Instance URL

To generate the API token from Collibra, follow these steps:

. Log in to Collibra and navigate to the *Admin* section.
. Click *API tokens*.
. Click *Generate API token*.
. Enter the token’s name and description, and select the expiry range from the drop-down menu.

. Enter the following credentials:

* User name
* Password
* Instance URL (for example, `+https://thoughtspot-partner.collibra.com/+`)

+
NOTE: Table verification status is referred to as ‘certificate’ in Collibra. While syncing, ThoughtSpot checks for tables that match those already connected to ThoughtSpot and imports only metadata for those tables.

. Click *Save and sync*.
+
Once the sync is complete, you see the *Last sync* field update in the Collibra tile. The *Sync schedule* field displays the frequency with which ThoughtSpot will sync with Collibra.

If the sync is taking a while, you can press the *Refresh* button to fetch the latest status.

== Edit a connection

You can edit catalog integration with Collibra to set off a sync immediately, edit your sync schedule, edit the metadata types imported to ThoughtSpot, or disconnect from Collibra.

To edit a connection with Collibra:

. Navigate to *Data* > *Data governance*.

. Click the more options icon image:icon-more-10px.png[icon] in the top right corner of the Collibra tile.

. Select from the following:

* *Sync now* to set off a sync immediately
* *Edit sync schedule* to change the cadence of your sync
* *Edit metadata* to add or remove metadata fields from your sync
* *Disconnect* to disconnect from Collibra. If you disconnect from Collibra, all metadata fields imported from Collibra disappear from ThoughtSpot.


== Informational panel display

The informational panel display below the Collibra catalog tile allows you to manage the metadata brought in for columns and data sources.

Click *Manage columns* to decide whether to display the column description in ThoughtSpot.

Click *Manage data sources* to decide whether to display the table description and table certificate status in ThoughtSpot.

=== Troubleshooting connection or sync failure

If the connection to Collibra or the scheduled sync fails for any reason, a *View logs* field appears next to the *Last sync* status on the Collibra tile in *Data governance*. You can view and download the log file to better understand why the connection failed.

=== Surfacing information on knowledge cards

// This section should talk about how the table and column description/certificate status actually appear on the Search data knowledge cards. Please include images to make it explicit

Once synced to ThoughtSpot, Collibra metadata is displayed on the knowledge cards that appear when you click on a column from the Search Data page. The verification status displays one of the following options: *Verified*, *Draft*, *Deprecated*, or *No certificate*. The catalog description displays the description written in Collibra.
