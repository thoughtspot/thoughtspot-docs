This article describes how you convert Worksheets to Models in ThoughtSpot. You can convert a single Worksheet to a Model immediately, or convert all of your Worksheets to Models when your ThoughtSpot instance is upgraded to the next release version.

[#convert-worksheet-single]
== Converting a single Worksheet to a Model

Use this option to manually convert a single Worksheet to a Model in ThoughtSpot.

To convert a single Worksheet to a Model, do the following:

. Navigate to the Data workspace.
. Open the Worksheet that you want to convert.
. Click the *More* menu image:icon-more-10px.png[More menu icon image] in the upper-right corner above your Worksheet, and click *Convert to Model*.
. In the pop-up confirmation window, click *Convert and Download TML*.
+
We provide the downloaded TML as a backup in case you see any issues you want to change once the Model is created.
+
Your new Model should be ready immediately for use with all dependents like Liveboards, Answers, and more.

[#convert-worksheet-bulk]
== Converting all Worksheets to Models

Use this option to automatically convert all of your Worksheets to Models when your ThoughtSpot instance is upgraded to the next release version.

To convert all of your Worksheets to Models when your ThoughtSpot instance is upgraded, do the following:

. Navigate to the *Admin* page.
. Go to the _Data modeling_ section by doing either of the following:
* For customers with Orgs NOT enabled, go to *Application Settings* > *Data modeling*.
* For customers with Orgs enabled, go to *All Orgs* > *Application Settings* > *Data modeling*.
. In the _Worksheet to Model conversion_ section, click *Edit*.
. To verify that all of your Worksheets can be converted to Models, click *Validate*.
. Do one of the following:
* If validation is successful, click the status slider to set the feature to image:icon-slider-toggle-enable-20px.png[Model conversion enabled] *Enabled* and click *Save*.
* If validation is NOT successful, click *Cancel* and contact {support-url} immediately for assistance.
. If your validation was successful, all of your Worksheets will be automatically converted to Models when your ThoughtSpot instance is upgraded to the next release version.
+
Once all of your Worksheets are converted to Models, all dependents like Liveboards and Answers, will work as expected with no disruption.
