:description: Learn about group aggregation functions, or pinned measures.

What if you want to aggregate a value by a specific attribute (for example, show revenue by product)?
This is known as a grouped aggregation, but some people call it a pinned measure or level-based measure.
You can do this for any aggregation using the grouping functions.

Each of the grouping functions accepts a measure and one or more optional attributes:

----
formula (measure, [attribute, attribute, ...])
----

Only the measure value is required.
If you supply both a measure and an attribute, the function returns the aggregate of the measure grouped by the attribute(s).
You should experiment with only a measure and then with an attribute to see which output best meets your use case.


== List of group functions

Group aggregation functions have names with formats like `group_<aggregation>`.
The group aggregation functions are the following:

|===
| Function | Description

| `group_aggregate`
| Takes a measure and optional attributes and filters. Used to aggregate measures with different granularities and filters than the columns used in the search.
| `group_average` | Takes a measure and one or more attributes. Returns the average of the measure grouped by the attribute(s).

`group_average (revenue, customer region)`
| `group_count` | Takes a measure and one or more attributes. Returns the count of the measure grouped by the attribute(s).

`group_count (revenue, customer region)`
| `group_max` | Takes a measure and one or more attributes. Returns the maximum of the measure grouped by the attribute(s).

`group_max (revenue, customer region)`
| `group_min` | Takes a measure and one or more attributes. Returns the minimum of the measure grouped by the attribute(s).

`group_min (revenue, customer region)`
| `group_stddev` | Takes a measure and one or more attributes. Returns the standard deviation of the measure grouped by the attribute(s).

`group_stddev (revenue, customer region)`
| `group_sum` | Takes a measure and one or more attributes. Returns the sum of the measure grouped by the attribute(s).

`group_sum (revenue, customer region)`
| `group_unique_count` | Takes a column name and one or more attributes. Returns the number of unique values in a column, grouped by the attribute(s).

`group_unique_count ( product, supplier)`
| `group_variance` | Takes a measure and one or more attributes. Returns the variance of the measure grouped by the attribute(s).

`group_variance (revenue, customer region)`

== Flexible aggregation

The `group_aggregate` function gives you more control over aggregation and filtering.

See xref:formulas-aggregation-flexible.adoc#[Flexible aggregation] to learn more about specifying `query_groups` with this formula.

== Limitations of group aggregation functions

Group aggregation functions have the following limitations:

* You can't run SpotIQ analysis on a visualization that contains a group aggregation function.

* You can't create a KPI chart with a group aggregation function.

* ThoughtSpot doesn't support aggregate table summaries for formulas that have group aggregates and are conditional.

* You can't run a `vs` query that also contains a group aggregation function.

* You can't run a group aggregation function on a group aggregation function.

* Any group aggregation function that returns a measure at the row level is implicitly reaggregated with a `sum` to match the level of detail defined in the Search bar. To circumvent this behavior, define the aggregation type within the formula, for example, `sum(revenue) + group_sum(tax)`. This behavior extends to `if...then..else` statements: `if(revenue = 0) then group_sum(revenue) else 0` would be reaggregated with a `sum`, while `if (sum(revenue) = 0) then group_sum(revenue) else 0` would not.
