:description: You can share Worksheets with users or with groups. Sharing a Worksheet allows users to select it as a data source and search it.

When you share a Worksheet, you give users or groups within your cluster access to the Worksheet's data.
You share all of its columns.
Sharing a Worksheet does not share the underlying tables.
If you want to share the underlying tables, see xref:share-source-tables.adoc#[Sharing tables and columns].

If you want to migrate the Worksheet to another cluster, or otherwise export it, see xref:scriptability.adoc[Migrate or restore Worksheets].

A Worksheet can be shared by the owner of the Worksheet, or by an administrator.
Users can start searching a Worksheet as soon as the Worksheet is shared with them.

You can share a Worksheet from the list of Worksheets under *Worksheets* <<share-datatab,on the *Data* tab>>, or from <<share-dataset,within the Worksheet>>.
