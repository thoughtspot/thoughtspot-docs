You can add a hyperlink directly within a search.
Using the concat formula, you can create an external hyperlink, or link your answer to another Liveboard.

== How to add a basic hyperlink

To add an external hyperlink in a search, follow these steps:

. Start a new search.
+
Alternatively, choose to edit an existing answer from a Liveboard.
. If the answer shows a chart, switch to *Table View*.

. In the upper-right side of the table, click the *More* menu icon image:icon-ellipses.png[more options menu icon], and select *Add formula*.
+

. Name your formula.
. Enter your formula, following the basic syntax:
+
----
 concat({caption}value{/caption}link)
----

 .. For a data set that does not contain properly formed urls, your formula should include the url in full. +
For example, to link from the Product Category column to a Google search, use the following syntax to reference the `product category` column, and a Google search using its values: +
+
----
 concat("{caption}",product category ,"{/caption}","https://www.google.com/search?q=",product category)
----

 .. For a data set that contains properly formed urls, you can simplify the formula.
+
For example, to link from the `Fruit` column to the `url`, use the following syntax to reference the two columns, `fruit` and `url`:
+
----
 concat("{caption}",fruit,"{/caption}",url)
----

. Click *Save*.

== How to link to another Liveboard

To add a hyperlink to another Liveboard, follow these steps:

. Start a new search. +
Alternatively, choose to edit an existing answer from a Liveboard.
. Choose the target Liveboard for the link.
. Open your target Liveboard and copy the web address.
. Within your Search, switch to *Table View*.
. In the upper-right side of the table, click the *More* menu icon image:icon-ellipses.png[more options menu icon]  and select *Add formula*.
+
image::formula-add-to-search.png[Create a new formula in an answer]

. Name your formula.
. Enter your formula, following the basic syntax:
+
----
 concat(“{caption}pinboard{/caption}http://<thoughtspot_server>:<port>/?<runtime filter>,column name)
----
+
For example, the formula to link between a search on fruit sales and a Liveboard based on the same data with url `https://.com/#/pinboard/e510f946-f9ce-48ad-a4af-1a40a9cf8add` would be: `concat("{caption}pinboard{/caption}https://.com/#/pinboard/e510f946-f9ce-48ad-a4af-1a40a9cf8add/?col1=fruit&op1=eq&val1=",fruit)`
+
Here, the runtime filter is operating on the column "`fruit,`" and will only return values that are equal (EQ) to the fruits listed in the columns.
