You can add a hyperlink directly within a search.
Using the concat formula, you can create an external hyperlink, or link your Answer to another Liveboard.

== How to add a basic hyperlink

To add an external hyperlink in a search, follow these steps:

. Start a new search.
+
Alternatively, choose to edit an existing Answer from a Liveboard.
. If the Answer shows a chart, switch to *Table View*

. Open the Data panel from the upper-right corner if it is not open, navigate to the *Category* image:icon-by-category.png[Category view] or *A to Z* image:icon-a-to-z.png[Alphabetical view] view, click *+ Add*, and select *Formula*. If the xref:answer-experience-new.adoc[new Answer experience] is off in your environment, select the *more options* icon image:icon-more-10px.png[more options menu icon] in the upper-right side of the table, and select *Add formula*.

. Name your formula.
. Enter your formula, following the basic syntax:
+
----
 concat({caption}value{/caption}link)
----

 .. For a data set that does not contain properly formed urls, your formula should include the url in full. +
For example, to link from the Product Category column to a Google search, use the following syntax to reference the `product category` column, and a Google search using its values: +
+
----
 concat("{caption}",product category ,"{/caption}","https://www.google.com/search?q=",product category)
----

 .. For a data set that contains properly formed urls, you can simplify the formula.
+
For example, to link from the `Fruit` column to the `url`, use the following syntax to reference the two columns, `fruit` and `url`:
+
----
 concat("{caption}",fruit,"{/caption}",url)
----

. Select *Save*.

== How to link to another Liveboard

To add a hyperlink to another Liveboard, follow these steps:

. Start a new search. +
Alternatively, choose to edit an existing Answer from a Liveboard.
. Choose the target Liveboard for the link.
. Open your target Liveboard and copy the web address.
. Within your Search, switch to *Table View*.
. In the *Data* side menu, scroll to *Formulas* and select the *+* icon. If the xref:answer-experience-new.adoc[new Answer experience] is off in your environment, select the *more options* icon image:icon-more-10px.png[more options menu icon] in the upper-right side of the table, and select *Add formula*.
+
image::formula-add-v2.png[Create a new formula in an Answer]

. Name your formula.
. Enter your formula, following the basic syntax:
+
----
 concat(â€œ{caption}pinboard{/caption}http://<thoughtspot_server>:<port>/?<runtime filter>,column name)
----
+
For example, the formula to link between a search on fruit sales and a Liveboard based on the same data with url `+https://<thoughtspot-instance>.com/#/pinboard/e510f946-f9ce-48ad-a4af-1a40a9cf8add+` would be: `+concat("{caption}pinboard{/caption}https://<thoughtspot-instance>.com/#/pinboard/e510f946-f9ce-48ad-a4af-1a40a9cf8add/?col1=fruit&op1=eq&val1=",fruit)+`
+
Here, the runtime filter is operating on the column "`fruit,`" and will only return values that are equal (EQ) to the fruits listed in the columns.
To learn more about runtime filters, see xref:runtime-filters.adoc[About runtime filters].

. Select *Save*.
