:description: If you want to search on top of another search, try saving your search as a view. Then, you can use the saved view as a data source for a new search.



This procedure walks you through creating a view from a search. To learn how to create a SQL view, see xref:sql-views.adoc[SQL views].

To create a view from a search:

. Start a new search, or edit an existing visualization from a Liveboard.
+
Any filters or aggregations created during this search will be reflected in the view.

. Make any changes to the visualization that you want in your saved view (change aggregation level, filters, etc.)
. Select the *more options* icon image:icon-more-10px.png[more options menu icon], and *Save as view*.
+
image::save_as_view.png[Select the more options icon, then select Save as view]

. Give the view a name and save it.
+
image::save_view_dialog.png[Save view dialog box]

. xref:relationship-create.adoc[Link] your view to any other data source, or define joins.

At this point the view has been saved.
