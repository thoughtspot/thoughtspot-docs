Spotter Agent is designed to interact with your questions naturally, offering avenues for further explanation of your data. You can now ask questions about your data, such as “How many columns are in this Model?” Spotter Agent can suggest questions you can ask to improve your understanding of the data analysis, and you can ask Spotter to answer multiple questions at once. For questions resulting in a chart or table, you can drill down on the answer, show underlying data, or use SpotIQ analyze.




With Spotter Agent, you can also ask questions about how calculated fields such as formulas are generated. Spotter Agent has also improved its responses for questions not related to the data model you selected.




== Sample conversation with Spotter Agent




For the following example, we will ask Spotter Agent to give data literacy and analysis on a sample Model for apparel retail.




To start, we will ask Spotter Agent for a quick overview of the data set. Note that Spotter Agent describes the number of columns in the Model, the purpose of the dataset, and key use cases. Spotter Agent also suggests columns and example questions for each use case.

Next, we can ask “Give me the total sales by region”, and Spotter Agent responds with a chart.

For suggestions on further analysis, we can ask Spotter Agent, “What can I ask next?” Spotter Agent suggests questions for four categories, Sales Analysis, Geographic Insights, Store Performance, and Product Analysis.

To dive deeper, we can simply ask, “Can you explain how the above answer is calculated?”
