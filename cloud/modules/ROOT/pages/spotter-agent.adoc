Spotter Agent is designed to interact with your questions naturally. Spotter Agent enhances the Spotter experience by helping you with the following:

* Answering data literacy questions
* Providing responses for questions not related to selected data model
* Providing suggestions on what questions to ask
* Providing details on how a metric is calculated
* Answering compound questions

== Enabling Spotter Agent

Spotter Agent can be enabled by selecting the Spotter answer experience as "Spotter agent" in the Admin panel's AI section. By default, "Classic experience" is selected.

Spotter experience must be enabled first for these flags to work.

Instances upgraded in 10.8.0.cl under BETA need to enable these flags again.

Reference the following table to see the behavior of the Spotter answer experience according to the flags enabled.
