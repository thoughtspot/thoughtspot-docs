Spotter Agent is designed to interact with your questions naturally. Spotter Agent enhances the Spotter experience by helping you with the following:

* Answering data literacy questions
* Providing responses for questions not related to selected data model
* Providing suggestions on what questions to ask
* Providing details on how a metric is calculated
* Answering compound questions

* Spotter Agent cannot change chart types.
* Although Spotter Agent cannot answer why questions, it will provide suggestions on how to further analyse your data.
* Spotter Agent currently does not support the ability to coach from a conversation.
* Coaching for non-data questions is not available, these questions are addressed based on metadata from the Worksheet or Model.
