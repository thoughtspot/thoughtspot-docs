When you create a connection to {connection} in ThoughtSpot, any data modeling or table joins are inherited automatically.

If there are no table joins in your {connection} connection, you can easily create them in ThoughtSpot.

The following example shows how the table joins were created in the Sales table of the Retail Sales Worksheet, available in your *try.thoughtspot.com* account created through {connection} Partner Connect.

== Creating table joins

The joins in the Sales table were created by doing the following:

. Select *Data* in the top navigation bar.
. Select the *Tables* tab at the top of the page.
. Select the *Sales* table.
+
The Columns view of the Sales table appears.

. Select the *Joins* tab.
. Select *+Add join*.
+
The Add Join window appears.

. In the Add Join window, use the dropdown menus to make the following selections:
 ** For Destination Table, select *Products*.
 ** For Source Columns, select *Product_Key*.
 ** For Destination Columns, select *Product_Key*.

+
image::snow-add-join.png[Specify source and destination tables and columns]
. Select *Next*.
. Enter the name _Product_Key - Product_Key_, a description for your join (optional), and select *Next*.
+
image::snow-add-join-name.png[Name the join]


+
NOTE: You can use any name you want.
The names we've chosen for this tutorial match those in the actual schema for this dataset on try.thoughtspot.com.
+
The first join is created.
Now you will add the other joins.

. Select *+Add join*.
. In the Add Join window, use the dropdown menus to make the following selections:
 ** For Destination Table, select *Customers*.
 ** For Source Columns, select *Customer_Key*.
 ** For Destination Columns, select *Customer_Key*.

+
image::snow-add-join2.png[Specify source and destination tables and columns]
. Select *Next*.
. Enter the name _Customer_Key - Customer_Key_, a description for your join (optional), and select *Next*.
+
image::snow-add-join-name2.png[Name the join]
. Select *+Add join*.
. In the Add Join window, use the dropdown menus to make the following selections:
 ** For Destination Table, select *Stores*.
 ** For Source Columns, select *Store_Key*.
 ** For Destination Columns, select *Store_Key*.

+
image::snow-add-join3.png[Specify source and destination tables and columns]
. Select *Next*.
. Enter the name _Store_Key-Store_Key_, a description for your join (optional), and select *Next*.
+
image::snow-add-join-name3.png[Name the join]
. Select *+Add join*.
. In the Add Join window, use the dropdown menus to make the following selections:
 ** For Destination Table, select *Dates*.
 ** For Source Columns, select *Date_Key*.
 ** For Destination Columns, select *Date_Key*.

+
image::snow-add-join4.png[Specify source and destination tables and columns]
. Select *Next*.
. Enter the name _Date_Key - Date_Key_, a description for your join (optional), and select *Next*.
+
image::snow-add-join-name4.png[Name the join]
+
Now that all four table joins are created, the schema looks like this:
+

=== Searching joined tables

You can easily search the joined tables, without having to create a Worksheet.

To search the joined tables, do the following:

. Select *Search*.
. Select the _Retail Sales_ data source, and click *Choose sources*.
. Select all the tables you just joined (Customers, Dates, Products, Sales, and Stores) and select *Close*.
. In the search bar, enter *sales_dollar_amount*, *store_region*, and *monthly _Date in Dates_*.
+
image::date-in-dates.png[Enter items in the search bar]
+
The search results look like this:
+
image::snow-search-results.png[Line chart with sales by date, sliced with color by region]
+
NOTE: When Monthly is a native keyword, it will work on any timestamp.
For the purposes of this example, we're using monthly as the date, from the Dates table.

. To confirm that the search is honoring the table joins, select the Query details icon image:icon-information-10px.png[query details icon], to the right of the chart.
+
image::partner-connect-query-details.png[View the query details]
. To confirm the search is bridging three different tables to create a result, select *Query visualizer*.
+
image::partner-connect-query-visualizer.png[Click on the query visualizer]

=== Best practices for data modeling

Here are some examples of how you can model your data to enhance searchability:

* Change column names
* Add synonyms for columns

In the following example, the _Sales_Dollar_Amount_ column was renamed to Sales and the synonyms of _Revenue_ and _Dollars_ were added.

image::snow-model-best.png[Update data modeling settings for your tables]

These are just a couple of examples of things you can do.

For more information about data modeling, see: xref:data-modeling-settings.adoc[Overview of data modeling settings]

== Creating a Worksheet

A Worksheet is a curated dataset built for ad hoc analysis, that allows you to translate data from a database into the language of your business users.

Examples of things you can do in a Worksheet include:

* Removing columns that aren't needed
* Adding data labels and synonyms
* Adding calculations, such as margin

The Worksheet based on the Sales table on *try.thoughtspot.com* was created by doing the following:

. Select *Data*.
. Click the *+ Create new* button, and select *Worksheet*.
. Select the plus icon, next to Sources.
+
image:worksheet_add_sources_link.png[Click the plus icon next to Sources]
. Select the checkbox next to all five of the tables from the Retail dataset in your schema.
+
image:partner-connect-tables-worksheet.png[Click on all your sources]
. Make sure the default setting of *Apply joins progressively* is selected.
This ensures that the search uses only the tables that are required.
. Select *Close*.
. In the Data view, select the name of the Customers table to reveal all of the columns in that table.
. Double-click each column from the Customers table that you want to include in the Worksheet.
+
Include these columns:

 ** Customer_Type
 ** Customer Name
 ** Customer_Gender
 ** Customer Region
 ** Customer State
 ** Customer City
 ** Customer Zip Code
 ** Customer County

. Use the same process to select columns from the other tables to include in the Worksheet.
+
From the Dates table, include this column:

 ** Date

+
From the Products table, include these columns:

 ** Product_Description
 ** Category_Description
 ** Department_Description

+
From the Sales table, include these columns:

 ** Sales_Dollar_Amount
 ** Cost_Dollar_Amount
 ** Gross_Profit_Dollar_Amount

+
From the Stores table, include these columns:

 ** Store_Name
 ** Store_Region
 ** Store_State
 ** Store_City
 ** Store_Zip_Code
 ** Store_County
+
image::partner-connect-columns-worksheet.png[Worksheet in progress with the columns specified earlier in the article]

+
NOTE: As a best practice, you would not select a key from a table when creating a Worksheet, because you would not want to search for the key.

. Select the pencil icon image:icon-edit-10px.png[edit icon] next to the current name of your Worksheet, enter the name *Retail Sales*, and select *Done*.
+
image::partner-connect-worksheet-title.png[Edit worksheet name]
. Click the *more options* icon image:icon-more-10px.png[more options menu icon], and select *Save*.
+
image::partner-connect-worksheet-save.png[Save the worksheet]
+
Now, let's add a percent gross margin formula to the Worksheet.

. Select *Edit Worksheet*.
. Next to Formulas, select the plus icon image:icon-add-10px.png[plus icon].
. In the formula window, do the following:
 .. In the top field, enter the formula title: *% Gross Margin*.
 .. In the next field, enter this formula:
+
----
sum ( gross_profit_dollar_amount ) / sum ( sales_dollar_amount ) * 100
----

 .. Select *Save*.
+
image::partner-connect-worksheet-formula.png[Save the formula]
. Save the Worksheet with the formula added, by selecting the *more options* icon image:icon-more-10px.png[more options menu icon], and selecting *Save*.
. Select *Data*, and select the Retail Sales Worksheet.
. In the Columns view, make sure that the % Gross Margin formula has the following settings:
 ** For DATA TYPE: *DOUBLE*
 ** For COLUMN TYPE: *MEASURE*
 ** For AGGREGATION: *AVERAGE*
. Save the Worksheet with the updated formula settings, by selecting the *more options* icon image:icon-more-10px.png[more options menu icon], and choosing *Save*.

=== Best practices for Worksheets

The best practices for data modeling also apply to Worksheets.

The example here includes:

* Changed column names
* Synonyms for columns
* % Gross Margin formula

=== Adding a currency and geo map to a Worksheet

To further enhance the usability of a Worksheet, you can add a specific currency type to monetary values, and a geographic map to regions in your data.

Using the Retail Sales Worksheet example, here's how geo maps and currency could be added:

. Select *Data*, and choose the *Retail Sales* Worksheet.
. In the Columns view, find the Sales column and select *None* in the Currency Type column.
. In the Specify Currency Type window, select *Specify ISO Code* and, then select *USD* from the dropdown menu.
+
image::partner-connect-currency.png[Specify ISO code to use the correct currency type]
. In the Columns view, find the Store_State column, and select *None* in the Geo Config column.
. In the Specify Geographic Configuration window, select *Specify Sub-nation region*, keep the default country of United States, and then select *State*.
+
image::partner-connect-geo-config.png[Specify geo config]
. Select *Save Changes*.
+
Now that both currency and geographic types are set, you can see those changes reflected when you search the Retail Sales Worksheet.

. Select *Search*.
. Select *Choose sources*.
. Deselect any tables previously selected (if needed), select only the *Retail Sales* Worksheet, and select *Close*.
. In the search bar, enter: *sales* *store state* and press tab.
+
The initial search results appear, but without labels for each state.
+
image::partner-connect-geo-curr-search-nolabels.png[Sales by state geo chart without labels]
+
The final step is to add the labels.

. Select the *Edit chart configuration* icon image:icon-gear-10px.png[gear icon].
. In the Customize panel, select the *Total Sales* tile.
. In the Edit column panel, select the *Data Labels* checkbox.
+
Now in the search results, you can see labels with the state name and total sales in US dollars.
