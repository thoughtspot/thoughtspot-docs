:description: Answer Explorer provides AI-guided exploration of Answers within Liveboards, so you can more easily find valuable and actionable information in your data.



Answer Explorer, ThoughtSpot's AI-guided exploration of Answers and headline metrics within Liveboards, provides you with valuable suggestions on how to explore and understand your data, based on two main criteria.
The Answer Explorer AI considers both popularity and personalization.
The feature suggests ways to answer questions that are relevant to many other users, and takes your own ThoughtSpot history into account.
Answer Explorer helps you better understand your data and get to actionable insights faster with just a click.

You can access Answer Explorer from any Answer or headline metric in a Liveboard.
Select the *Explore* button that appears when you hover over any Answer or headline.

The Answer expands to fill your screen, and the *Explore* modal appears, on the *Filter* screen.

You can explore your data in several ways, by using <<explore-filters,filters>>, <<explore-add,adding>> or <<explore-replace,replacing>> attributes or measures, or <<explore-comparisons,comparing>> attribute values.

Note that when you explore a headline, you can only use Answer Explorer to <<explore-filters,filter>> on it.

Answer Explorer's AI updates its suggestions every time you add something new to your visualization.
If you add a suggested filter, Answer Explorer then suggests new filters, comparisons, and columns to add or replace, based on that new filter in your chart.
For example, in a retail data set, you might choose to add a filter for the *west* region.
Answer Explorer might then suggest you *add* your data's _store state_ column, since you are interested in how your stores perform based on location.
In this way, Answer Explorer's suggestions become more relevant for you as you continue to use the feature.

After you make a change to your Answer, you may want to undo or redo an action. Use the in-product undo, redo, and reset buttons to reset or go back or forward 1 step each time you make a change. These buttons appear to the right of the visualization title in the *Explore* modal.
The Reset icon returns the visualization to its last saved state.

[#explore-filters]
== Filters

Use *Filters* to narrow down your search result to only include the data you want to see.
Answer Explorer uses sophisticated technology to show only the most relevant suggestions.
Select a suggested filter to add it to your visualization.

NOTE: In Answer Explorer, you can only filter on *attribute* columns, not *measures*.

=== Add your own filters

If you want to filter on a column value that Answer Explorer did not suggest, you can add your own filter.

. Select *+ Add filter*.
+

. Choose an attribute column to filter on.
For example, if you are a store manager for the *east* region, you may want to see monthly sales specific to the east region.
You would choose to filter on the *store region* column.

. Choose the filter condition: either _equals_ `=` or _does not equal_ `!=`.

. Choose the column value you would like to filter on.

. Select *Apply*.

[#explore-add]
== Add attributes or measures

Under the *Add* tab, add attributes or measures to visualize your data with more detail.
For example, add _Store State_ to see which states have the best sales.
Add _gross profit margin_ to view both sales and gross profit margin by month.

=== Add your own attributes or measures

If you want to add an attribute or measure that Answer Explorer did not suggest, you can add your own, using the *Add column* search bar.

. Select the search bar under *Add your own*.
. Choose a column to add to your visualization.

[#explore-replace]
== Replace attributes or measures

Under the *Replace* tab, replace one attribute or measure with another.
For example, if your Answer has a time attribute, you can easily change from _monthly_ to _quarterly_, and so on.

=== Choose your own attributes or measures to replace

If you want to replace an attribute or measure that Answer Explorer did not suggest, you can choose your own, using the *Replace column* search bar.

. Open the dropdown menu under *Select a column to replace*.
. Choose an attribute or measure in your visualization to replace.
. Select the *And replace with your own column* search bar that appears.
. Choose an attribute or measure to add to your visualization.

[#explore-comparisons]
== Compare attribute values

Under the *Compare* tab, you can easily perform a _versus_ analysis.
For example, Answer Explorer might suggest you compare your best- and worst-performing products, or one store region to another.

image::explore-compare-new-experience.png[Compare attribute values]

=== Choose your own values to compare

If you want to compare values that Answer Explorer did not suggest, you can choose your own, using the *comparisons* search bar.

. Select *Add values*.
. Choose an attribute column whose values you would like to compare.
For example, choose *department* if you would like to compare your bakery and produce departments.
. Select the 2 column values you would like to compare.
. Select *Apply*.

== Drill down with Answer Explorer


When you Drill down in Answer Explorer, you have the option of going back one step at a time, using the Back icon image:icon-arrow-left-10px.png[Back icon image].
If you are using the classic Liveboard experience, you cannot go back one step at a time if you Drill down on an Answer in a Liveboard, without using Answer Explorer.

See xref:search-drill-down.adoc[Drill down].

== Save your new Answer

When you find a valuable insight using Answer Explorer, you may want to save that Answer as it appears, instead of trying to recreate it in the *Search* bar.

. Open the *More* menu icon image:icon-more-10px.png[More menu icon image].
. Select *Copy and edit*, or *Make a copy*, depending on your xref:liveboard-experience-new.adoc[Liveboard experience].
. *Save* your new Answer within ThoughtSpot and continue working with it.
. Alternatively, select *Download* to download an image of your current visualization.

You can also *pin* the current Answer to any Liveboard you have *edit* access to.
Select the *pin* icon image:icon-pin.png[Pin icon image] and select a Liveboard. Note that in Liveboard v2, you see a *Pin* button rather than an icon.

Otherwise, the Answer returns to its original state when you exit the *Explore* menu by selecting the _X_ icon.
