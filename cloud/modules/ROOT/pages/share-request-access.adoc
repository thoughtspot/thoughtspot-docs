:description: If you cannot view a Liveboard or Answer in ThoughtSpot, you can request access to it.



== Request view access

If you try to share a Liveboard or Answer by copying and pasting a link to it, the person you share it with may have to request access.
You can avoid this by sharing xref:share-liveboards.adoc[using the sharing icon.]

If a user receives a link to a Liveboard or Answer for which they have neither view nor edit access, the *Request Access* page appears.

The user adds an optional message explaining why they need to view or edit the Liveboard or Answer, and clicks *Request access* to send an email to the Liveboard or Answer owner.
The email also goes to your administrators, anyone with *edit* access for the Liveboard or Answer, and to https://community.thoughtspot.com/customers/s/contactsupport[ThoughtSpot Support].

A message appears, telling the user who owns the Liveboard or Answer.
ThoughtSpot sends an email notification, requesting view or edit access, to the Liveboard or Answer owner, anyone with *edit* access for the Liveboard or Answer, all cluster administrators, and ThoughtSpot Support.
The email includes the user's optional message.
Any of the users who got the request then shares the Liveboard or Answer with the user.

TIP: You can turn off sharing request emails for users with edit access on objects.

== Request edit access

You may have view only access to a Liveboard or Answer.
If you don't have edit privileges, you cannot save any changes you make to the Liveboard or Answer.
You cannot pin an Answer to that Liveboard, change the Liveboard or Answer layout, or delete a visualization.

If you have view only access, the locked icon image:icon-locked-10px.png[Locked icon image] appears next to the Liveboard or Answer name.

If you click on that icon, it allows you to request access to the Liveboard or Answer to edit it.
You can add an optional message.

== Request data access

If you don't have access to a Liveboard or Answer's underlying data source, you cannot use features that involve columns based on data you do not have access to.
For example, you cannot filter on the Liveboard or Answer, drill down, or run SpotIQ.
If you attempt to use these features, a notification appears, telling you to request access to the underlying data source.
