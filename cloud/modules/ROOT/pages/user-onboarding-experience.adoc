When you begin using ThoughtSpot, the onboarding process starts automatically and guides you through a few basic scenarios.

Usually, you receive an email welcoming you to the onboarding process at ThoughtSpot.

== How onboarding works for the user

Your onboarding experience begins when you sign in for the first time.

. *Step 1: Get Started* +
The initial welcome screen provides an overview of the onboarding process, and offers a quick video.
+
Watch the video, and select *Continue*.
+
Alternatively, you can select *Exit to homepage* at the upper-right corner of the screen, and end the onboarding process.
This option appears at this and every subsequent step.
