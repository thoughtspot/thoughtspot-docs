:description: You can delete a relationship between tables through the ThoughtSpot application.


You can delete a relationship or join between tables through the ThoughtSpot application.

You must have either the xref:groups-privileges.adoc[*Can administer ThoughtSpot* or the *Can manage data* privilege] to delete a relationship.
If you are not an administrator, you also need edit permissions on the table, view, or worksheet.

== Delete a relationship

To delete a relationship from the Web interface:

. Click *Data* on the top navigation bar.
. Find the origin table, worksheet or view of the join you want to delete through browsing, Search, or selecting the appropriate Tag(s).
. Click the name of the data source from which you want to remove the relationship.
. Click *Joins*.
You will see the list showing existing joins.
If you want to delete an external join from a worksheet, you must click *Joins within this worksheet* and choose *Joins from this worksheet*.

. Click the *Delete icon* to the right of the join name.
The *Confirm delete* window appears.
. Click *Delete*.

== Delete or edit a relationship that has dependents

If a relationship has dependents, and you need to delete the relationship, edit or reverse the join cardinality, or edit the join keys or condition, the process is slightly different. After you delete a relationship with dependents, the dependents still exist, but stop working until you create the relationship again and fix the first-level dependents, either by selecting *Edit worksheet > Fix worksheet* for worksheets, or selecting *Save* for answers or Liveboards.

*Only* delete a relationship with dependents if you plan to edit the relationship and add it in again, or if you can also delete the dependents.

For example, you can use this functionality to reverse the join cardinality.

=== Reverse join cardinality
You can use the delete functionality to reverse or change the join cardinality for a join that has dependents. To reverse the join cardinality, follow these steps:

. Click the *Delete icon* to the right of the join name.
.. A warning appears, telling you that deleting the join will make dependent objects stop working. Make a note of these objects.

. Select *Delete*.
. At this point, the dependents still exist, but are unusable.
. Create the join again, with the opposite cardinality, and any other changes you must make.
. Navigate to any first-level dependents for the join. For example, you may have a join between two tables. You created a worksheet based on these two tables and the join. You created several answers based on the worksheet. Only the worksheet is a first-level dependent. The answers are not first-level dependents.
. If the first-level dependents are worksheets, select *Edit worksheet* for each worksheet, select *Fix worksheet* in the top-right corner, and then *Save* the worksheets. If the first-level dependents are answers or Liveboards, select *Save* for each object. Now all dependents are usable.


If a join does not have dependents, you can change the join cardinality by xref:relationship-create.adoc#join-edit[editing the join]. This allows you to change a many-to-one join to one-to-one. To reverse the join cardinality, you must delete the join and create it again with the opposite cardinality.
