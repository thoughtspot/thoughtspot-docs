:description: You can delete a relationship between tables through the ThoughtSpot application.




You must have either the xref:groups-privileges.adoc[*Can administrator ThoughtSpot* or the *Can manage data* privilege] to delete a relationship.
If you're not an administrator, you also need edit permissions on the table, view, or worksheet.

== To delete a relationship from the Web interface:

. Click *Data* on the top navigation bar.
. Find the origin table, worksheet or view of the join you want to delete through browsing, Search, or selecting the appropriate Tag(s).
. Click the name of the data source from which you want to remove the relationship.
. Click *Joins*.
You will see the list showing existing joins.
If you want to delete an external join from a worksheet, you must click *Joins within this worksheet* and choose *Joins from this worksheet*.

. Click the *Delete icon* to the right of the join name.
The *Confirm delete* window appears.
. Click *Delete*

NOTE: If existing answers or Liveboards depend on the join you are deleting, you will see the *Cannot delete* window listing all dependents of the join.
You must delete all dependents before you can delete the join.
