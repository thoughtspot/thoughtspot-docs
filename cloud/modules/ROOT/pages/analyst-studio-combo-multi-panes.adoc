This example will walk you through how to create a chart that is a combination of different mark types.


1. Add a field to *Columns*. This is generally what you want to see on your x-axis. The example below uses a time series.

2. Add measures to *Rows*. These are fields that you may want to plot on your y-axis. Each measure corresponds to a Layer in your visualization. The example below examines the total quantity of orders received and the total dollar amount of those orders.

3. Each Layer has its own set of properties, which means you can configure each Layer independently of one another. In the example below, weâ€™ve sliced the `SUM(order_total_qty)` Layer by Region (top pane) and added labels to the `SUM(order_total_amt_usd)` Layer (bottom pane).
