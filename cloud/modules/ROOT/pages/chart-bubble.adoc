The bubble chart is a variation of the scatter chart, and its data points appear as bubbles. Your search must have at least one attribute and two measures to generate a bubble chart.

The bubble chart displays three to five dimensions or measures of data. In addition to the traditional X and Y axis, the xref:size[size] of the bubble represents a measurement. Bubble charts can show two more attributes, when you xref:slice[slice] and/or xref:slice-color[slice by color].

[#size]

The size of each bubble depends on the measure you choose under *Edit chart* image:icon-gear-10px.png[edit chart icon].

[#slice]
[#slice-color]
== Slice and slice by color

This chart type lets you *slice* and xref:chart-column-configure.adoc#slice-with-color[slice with color].
You can also *slice* xref:chart-scatter.adoc[scatter charts].

Slicing helps you to break up data based on a specific column. In the following illustration, we sliced the chart by `store type`. We also used `store region` to slice by color.
If you hover over a data point, you can see what store type and store region it represents. Here, we have a `large` store in the `west` region:
