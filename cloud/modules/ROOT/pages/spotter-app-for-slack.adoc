You can now ask questions to Spotter right within Slack. Install the ThoughtSpot app in Slack, add it to a Slack channel, and you will be able to ask questions on your data sources in natural language. ThoughtSpot answers in chart format. To enable the ThoughtSpot Slack app, contact your {support-url}.

IMPORTANT: The ThoughtSpot app in Slack is currently not available on AWS instances outside the US and ThoughtSpot Everywhere (TSE) instances.

== Features of Spotter

=== Answering data questions

Users can ask data questions by entering queries in a natural language format.

* This functionality requires adding the Spotter to a channel and pinning a Worksheet/Model.

* Note: Spotter will only work if the end user has *Can download data* and *Can use Sage* privileges.

* For example, typing `@Spotter show me the top 10 products for this quarter` will prompt the app to process the query and return results in a visual format (provided the appropriate dataset is selected).

This feature enables users to access data insights directly from Slack, streamlining workflows without switching applications.

NOTE: Spotter's responses are AI-generated and may require verification.

== Add Spotter to a channel

After connecting to Spotter for Slack:

. Add the app to a channel to start asking.
. Use the following commands:

* `/spotter-help` to get help on using Spotter.
* `/spotter-show-models` to see the top Worksheets in your ThoughtSpot account.
* `/spotter-show-columns` to see columns in the Worksheet pinned to the channel.

. Pin a Worksheet/Model to the channel by selecting it and clicking *Pin Worksheet/Model*. After pinning, you can query the worksheet using commands like `@Spotter <question>`.

. Follow-up questions can be asked in the same thread, with the app maintaining context for coherent responses.

Context handling:

* The app will display a loading message for each question until an answer is generated.
* Users cannot ask additional questions in the same thread until the previous answer is displayed.
* Only the user who initiated the conversation will be able to ask follow-up questions.

== Notifications

Once connected, users will receive all notifications from ThoughtSpot directly in the Slack app. You can select which notifications you want to receive, allowing you to customize your experience and stay updated on relevant activities and changes within your ThoughtSpot environment.

== Link unfurling

If the Spotter app is connected, it will unfurl any shared links for the ThoughtSpot cluster and display an image of the object, providing a visual context to your shared content.

== Automatic disconnection

Please note that Slack may occasionally get disconnected automatically due to various reasons, such as token expiration or network issues. In such cases, users will need to reconnect to restore functionality.

== Disconnect from Slack

You can disconnect from Slack at any time by going to your user profile in ThoughtSpot and clicking *Disconnect from Slack*.
