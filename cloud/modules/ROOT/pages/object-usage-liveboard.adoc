Use this Liveboard to understand what users have accessed, and to identify unused objects you can delete.
For more detailed information on individual users' actions within ThoughtSpot, filter the Liveboard by user from the filter bar under the Liveboard name.

The Object Usage Liveboard contains information about the following topics:

* Specifies what Worksheets, tables, and views users search on
* Specifies what columns in existing Worksheets, tables and views users search most frequently
* Shows a month-over-month comparative view of usage for each object type
* Displays the top users for the last 30 days
* Displays a pivot table of most frequent usage by object type, and by user
* Displays monthly usage of Worksheets, tables and views to help identify objects with low or no usage (Monthly Worksheet Volume, Monthly Table Volume, Monthly View Volume)

//NOTE: When an object is deleted, it no longer appears in the Object Usage Liveboard. This ensures a more accurate count of objects in use on your cluster.
