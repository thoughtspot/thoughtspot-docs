The ThoughtSpot plug-in for Microsoft PowerPoint(TM) is an add-in that allows you to connect to a ThoughtSpot instance, and pull data directly into a PowerPoint slide sheet from trusted data sources connected to that instance (like Snowflake, Google BigQuery, Databricks, and others) for ad-hoc analysis.
