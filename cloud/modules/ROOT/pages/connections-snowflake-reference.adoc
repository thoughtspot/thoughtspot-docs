Here is a list of the fields of a {connection} connection.
You need specific information to establish a seamless and secure connection.
All fields are required, except where noted.
[#connection-name]
Connection name::  Enter a new {connection} connection name.
[#connection-description]
Connection description::
Provide a short description of the connection.
_(Optional)_
[#account-name]
Account name::
Enter the account name associated with your Snowflake connection. If you used an xref:connections-snowflake-private-link.adoc[AWS PrivateLink between your Snowflake data warehouse and the ThoughtSpot Cloud tenant], use the PrivateLink Snowflake account name provided by {support-url}. For example, `xyz99999.us-west-2.privatelink`.
+
The account name is part of the URL that you use to access the {connection} UI.
It is the portion of the URL before `snowflakecomputing.com`. +
*Example*: If your URL is `+https://abcd.xyz.efg.snowflakecomputing.com+`, your account name is `abcd.xyz.efg`. If your URL is `+https://app.snowflake.com/adetgjc/nof9345+`, your account name is `adetgjc-nof9345`. You can find your account name by using the "copy account link" function in the Snowflake admin console.

Assume that the *account name* is _xy12345_.

_(Optional)_

////
[#schema]

[#oauth]
(OAuth and OAuth with PKCE only) OAuth Client ID:: Enter the OAuth client ID associated with the {connection} database.
+
(External OAuth) Enter the client id of the OAuth application created in the identity provider.
[#oauth-client-secret]
(OAuth and OAuth with PKCE only) OAuth client secret:: Enter the OAuth client secret associated with the {connection} database.
+
(External OAuth) Enter the client secret of the OAuth application created in the identity provide
[#oauth-scope]

For OAuth with Azure AD provider, it should be similar to `\https://<APPLICATION_ID_URI>/session:role:developer offline_access openid`.
For more information, see: xref:connections-snowflake-azure-ad-oauth.adoc#step-8[part 1, step 8] in Configure Azure AD external OAuth for a {connection} connection.
+
For OAuth with Okta, it should be similar to `session:role:developer offline_access openid`.
[#oauth-url]
(OAuth and OAuth with PKCE only) Auth Url:: ThoughtSpot performs an "Authorization Code" grant type flow to get the access token. Get the authorization endpoint for the respective identity provider from its console.
+
For Azure AD, it can be obtained from the Azure portal by navigating to Azure Active Directory resource. It should be similar to *\https://login.microsoftonline.com/<tenant_id>/oauth2/v2.0/authorize*.
+
For Okta, it should be similar to *\https://<organization>.okta.com/oauth2/<alphanumeric id>/v1/authorize*.
[#oauth-token-url]
(OAuth and OAuth with PKCE only) Access Token Url:: (External OAuth) Enter the Access Token Url associated with your external identity provider.
+
For Azure AD, it can be obtained from the Azure portal by navigating to Azure Active Directory resource. It should be similar to *\https://login.microsoftonline.com/<tenant_id>/oauth2/v2.0/token*.
