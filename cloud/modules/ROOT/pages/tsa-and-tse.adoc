ThoughtSpot offers two main products aimed at different customer use cases:

- ThoughtSpot Analytics (TSA) Cloud and Software
- ThoughtSpot Embedded (TSE)

This article defines each product including its use case, and provides examples of how it can be used.

== Definitions of TSA and TSE

*TSA* is designed for internal use, enabling users within a customer's organization to create or access AI-driven insights. Customers embedding ThoughtSpot into an _internal-facing_ portal will need the Embedded Analytics Add-on.

*TSA with the Embedded Analytics Add-on* allows customers to embed ThoughtSpot in _internal portals_ for easier user access.

*TSE* is designed for _external_ use, enabling customer analysts and developers to create and manage analytics content in their ThoughtSpot cluster for delivery in an external application. All analytics usage should occur through the external application through embedded sessions. TSE customers can use a TSA cluster for the sole purpose of authoring, distributing, supporting, and reporting on the usage of the ThoughtSpot Embedded use case(s).
