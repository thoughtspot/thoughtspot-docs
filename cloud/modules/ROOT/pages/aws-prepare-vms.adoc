Prepare the VMs before installing your ThoughtSpot cluster(s).

. SSH into a VM.

[source,console]
----
$ ssh -i key.pem admin@<VM-IP>
----

. Run `sudo /usr/local/scaligent/bin/prepare_disks.sh` to configure the VMs.
+
WARNING: Make sure you migrate any data off the disks.
This command formats the disks, wiping them clean.
+
[source,console]
----
$ sudo /usr/local/scaligent/bin/prepare_disks.sh
----

. Configure the VM based on your specific network information.
Refer to your site-survey or ask your network administrator for that information.
. Run `df -h` to confirm configuration.
+
[source,console]
----
$ df -h
----

. Repeat these steps for each of your VMs.

When complete, your storage is mounted and ready for use with your cluster.

When the setup completes, you can load data into ThoughtSpot for search analytics.
