== Create a new Report

. Click the app switcher icon in the top navigation bar and select *{product}*.
. Click on the *New* image:modal-add.svg[new] button in the upper right corner of the window.
. A new, empty Report will be created in your personal Collection.

== Star a Report

Use stars to privately mark the Reports you use the most so you can find them quickly.
To star a Report:

. Navigate to the Collection where the Report is located.
. Hover over the Report thumbnail;
an empty star will appear next to the Report name.
. Click on the *Star* image:inline-star-default.svg[star].

To see a list of all the starred Reports, regardless of where they live, click on *Starred* on the left side of your {product} home page.
To remove a star from a Report, repeat the above steps.

== Duplicate a Report

{product} lets you copy an existing Report so that you can modify or build on it without making changes to the original.
You can duplicate any Report that you created.
You can duplicate any Report visible to you, as long as you have access to all of the database connections used in that Report.

To duplicate a Report:

. Navigate to the Collection containing the Report you want to duplicate.
. Hover over the Report thumbnail and click the overflow menu icon image:menu-dots-gray-press.svg[menu] that appears in the upper right.
. Alternatively, you can access the same affordance from the *Report Settings* menu in the header while editing a Report, or the *More* menu in the header when viewing.
. Click *Duplicate*.
. Stay on the page to be notified when the copy is ready and available to use.
. A duplicated Report, including all code, results, and visualizations, will be created in your personal Collection with you as the creator.

You may now modify this duplicated Report without impacting the original Report in any way.

== Archive a Report

You can archive Reports that you want to hide from view but are not yet ready to delete.
To archive a Report:

. Navigate to the Collection containing the Report you want to archive.
. Hover over the Report thumbnail and click on the overflow menu icon image:menu-dots-gray-press.svg[menu] that appears in the upper right.
. Click *Archive*.
. The Report will be hidden from view, but it will not be modified in any other way.

Archived Reports are still accessible to Workspace members via direct link or search, and will have an archived badge.
You can see all of the archived Reports in a Collection by navigating to that Collection and clicking on the *View All Reports* dropdown in the upper right, and clicking *Archive*.
You can unarchive any of the Reports in this view by hovering over the Report thumbnail, clicking on the overflow menu icon image:menu-dots-gray-press.svg[menu] button that appears in the upper right, and clicking *Unarchive*.

== Delete a Report

Deleting a Report removes it from your Workspace, including all of its code, results, run history, and visualizations.
When you delete a Report, it will no longer be visible in {product}, and links to that Report will no longer work.
To delete a Report:

. Navigate to the Collection containing the Report you want to delete.
. Hover over the Report thumbnail and click on the overflow menu icon image:menu-dots-gray-press.svg[menu]that appears in the upper right.
. Click *Delete*.

When you delete a Report, it will no longer be accessible by anyone in your {product} Workspace.
To recover a deleted Report, contact {support-url}.

[#move-a-report-to-another-collection]
== Move a Report to another Collection

. Navigate to the Collection containing the Report you want to move.
. Click the overflow menu icon image:menu-dots-gray-press.svg[menu] in the upper right corner.
. Click *Move to...*
. Find and click on the Collection to which you want to move the Report.
. Click *Move*.

You can move Reports that you can edit into any Collection that you have edit access to.
If you have view-only access to a Collection, you will not be able to move Reports into it.

NOTE: Once you move a Report from your xref:analyst-studio-spaces.adoc#personal-space[personal Collection] to another Collection, you cannot move it back. A workaround would be to duplicate the Report back to your personal Collection.

//You cannot move a Report to the xref:analyst-studio-spaces.adoc#community-space[community Collection] if any query within it has ever been run against any database other than the {product} Public Warehouse.
