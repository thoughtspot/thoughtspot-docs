== Before you begin

You must have administrator-level permissions to create a table in the database of the cloud data warehouse of the connection.

== Methods of creating a custom calendar

Use one of the following methods to create a custom calendar:

* Create a calendar
* Upload a file
* Use an existing table

== Creating a custom calendar

You can create one of the following calendar types:

* Month offset
* Four Four Five
* Four Five Four
* Five Four Four

If you need to create a different type of calendar, including one that uses a different language for the names of months or days of the week, you must upload your custom calendar file.
In this case, ThoughtSpot suggests you first create a calendar in one of the supported calendar types to use as a template, by following these steps.
After that, you can download and xref:connections-cust-cal-update.adoc#update-cal[update] it to your specific requirements.

=== Formatting the calendar table

The following DDL shows the custom calendar table creation for Snowflake. Other data warehouses will have a similar structure. The name of the table isn’t important, you will specify the name to ThoughtSpot.  The columns and type are important, however.

[source]
----
create or replace TABLE FISCAL_CAL(
  "date" DATE,
  "day_of_week" VARCHAR(),
  "month" VARCHAR(),
  "quarter" VARCHAR(),
  "year" VARCHAR(),
  "day_number_of_week" BIGINT,
  "week_number_of_month" BIGINT,
  "week_number_of_quarter" BIGINT,
  "week_number_of_year" BIGINT,
  "is_weekend" BOOLEAN,
  "monthly" VARCHAR(),
  "quarterly" VARCHAR(),
  "day_number_of_month" BIGINT,
  "day_number_of_quarter" BIGINT,
  "day_number_of_year" BIGINT,
  "month_number_of_quarter" BIGINT,
  "month_number_of_year" BIGINT,
  "quarter_number_of_year" BIGINT,
  "absolute_week_number" BIGINT,
  "start_of_week_epoch" DATE,
  "end_of_week_epoch" DATE,
  "absolute_month_number" BIGINT,
  "start_of_month_epoch" DATE,
  "end_of_month_epoch" DATE,
  "absolute_quarter_number" BIGINT,
  "start_of_quarter_epoch" DATE,
  "end_of_quarter_epoch" DATE,
  "absolute_year_number" BIGINT,
  "start_of_year_epoch" DATE,
  "end_of_year_epoch" DATE,
 PRIMARY KEY ("date" )
);
----

=== Populating the calendar

Once the table has been created, you need to populate the table with the appropriate data. The date (first column) is the actual calendar date that will be used to map to the custom date values. The following example shows a few records. In this case, the day and month names have been changed to Spanish, the first month is June, and the first day of the week is Monday.

`2021-06-01,martes,junio,QTR1,YR2021,2,1,1,1,false,junio YR2021,QTR1 YR2021,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2021-06-01,2021-06-08,1,2021-06-01,2021-07-01,1,2021-06-01,2021-09-01,1,2021-06-01,2022-06-01`

`2022-05-28,sábado,mayo,QTR4,YR2021,6,5,13,52,true,mayo YR2021,QTR4 YR2021,28,89,362,3,12,4,52,2022-05-23,2022-05-30,12,2022-05-01,2022-06-01,4,2022-03-01,2022-06-01,1,2021-06-01,2022-06-01`

== Using your custom calendar in your connection

After you create your custom calendar, you must specify where to use it in your connection.

To use your custom calendar, do the following:

. Sign in to your ThoughtSpot cluster and select *Data* > *Connections*.
. Select the name of the connection where you want to use your calendar.
. Select the name of the table where you want to use your calendar.
. Find the column where you want to use your calendar.
+
NOTE: The column must use the DATE or DATE_TIME data type.

. Refresh the page to make sure your custom calendar is available.
. Scroll horizontally to the CALENDAR TYPE column.
. In the CALENDAR TYPE column for the column(s) you chose, double-click the existing calendar name (example: "None"), and then select your custom calendar.
. Select *Save Changes*.
+
Now, date-related searches in the selected table use your custom calendar.
+
After creating a custom calendar, you can easily look at it to confirm it is set up the way you want.
For details, see <<view-cust-cal,View a custom calendar>>.
