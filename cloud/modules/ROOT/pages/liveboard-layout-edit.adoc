:description: Editing the layout of a Liveboard lets you snap visualizations into place, choose between set visualization sizes, and reset your layout.



Editing the layout of a Liveboard lets you snap visualizations into place and change the visualization size.

Visualizations within a Liveboard are easy to move around and snap into place on a relative flow layout. This helps keep the layout of your Liveboard neat and organized.

Your Liveboard layout reacts to your browser width and resolution. If you decrease your browser width or resolution, a horizontal scroll bar appears at the lower edge of your screen.

== Reorder the visualizations

You can reorder the visualizations in a Liveboard by dragging and dropping them in *Edit* mode. To change the visualization layout, follow these steps:

. Select *Liveboards*, on the top navigation bar.
. Navigate to the Liveboard you would like to edit.
. Select the *Edit* button at the upper right of the Liveboard. If this button is grayed out, you do not have edit privileges for the Liveboard. To resolve this, contact your administrator or the creator of the Liveboard.
. Select the bar that appears at the top of any visualization when you hover over it. This allows you to drag and drop your visualizations to new positions in the Liveboard.

== Move a visualization to a different tab

. Select the *Edit* button at the upper right of the Liveboard.

. Select the *More* menu image:icon-more-10px.png[more menu icon] for the visualization you would like to move to another tab.

. Select *Move to tab*. This option is not available if the Liveboard has only one tab, or if the Liveboard has no tabs.

. Select *Move*.

. Select *Save* in the top menu.

[#size]
== Change the size of a visualization

You can customize your Liveboard visualizations to be any size. You can also use the size picker at the bottom of a visualization's *More* menu image:icon-more-10px.png[more options menu icon] in edit mode to choose between predetermined sizes for each visualization. All visualizations have 5 predetermined size options, in addition to the custom size option.
To change the size of a visualization with custom tile sizes, follow these steps:

. Navigate to the Liveboard you would like to edit.
. Select the *Edit* button at the upper right of the Liveboard. If this button is grayed out, you do not have edit privileges for the Liveboard. To resolve this, contact your administrator or the creator of the Liveboard.
. Select the size changing icon in the lower-right corner of any visualization, and drag the visualization to the correct size using your mouse. Alternatively, use the 5 predetermined sizes, by selecting the visualization's *More* menu image:icon-more-10px.png[more menu icon]. The last item in the More menu shows different possible sizes, with the current size selected.

[#copy-edit]
== Make a copy of a visualization from your Liveboard

To create a copy of a visualization and edit it, follow these steps:

. Navigate to the Liveboard that contains the visualization you would like to copy and edit.
. In the upper-right corner of the visualization you would like to edit, select the *More* icon image:icon-more-10px.png[more options menu icon].
. Select *Make a copy*. Note that this option is only available in *View* mode.
+
A copy of the Answer that created the visualization opens in a new tab, with "`Copy of`" added to the beginning of the title.

. Make any changes you want to the visualization.
. Click the *More* icon image:icon-more-10px.png[more options menu icon] and select *Save*.
