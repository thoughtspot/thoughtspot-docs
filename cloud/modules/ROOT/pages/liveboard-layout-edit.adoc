Visualizations within a Liveboard are easy to move around and snap into place on a relative flow layout.
Your Liveboard layout is also responsive to your browser resolution.
This helps keep the layout of your Liveboard neat and organized.

== Reorder the visualization

In addition, the size picker at the bottom of a visualization's three-dot Actions menu lets you toggle between predetermined sizes for each visualization.
Charts and graphs can be toggled between a small, medium, and full width size, while headlines can be only one size (small).
One row of the Liveboard can hold a predetermined number of visualizations of each size.
