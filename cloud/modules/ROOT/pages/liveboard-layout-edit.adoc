Editing the layout of a Liveboard lets you snap visualizations into place and change the visualization size.

Visualizations within a Liveboard are easy to move around and snap into place on a relative flow layout. This helps keep the layout of your Liveboard neat and organized.

Your Liveboard layout reacts to your browser width and resolution. If you decrease your browser width or resolution, a horizontal scroll bar appears at the lower edge of your screen.

== Reorder the visualizations

You can reorder the visualizations in a Liveboard by dragging and dropping them in *Edit* mode. To change the visualization layout, follow these steps:

. Click *Liveboards*, on the top navigation bar.
. Navigate to the Liveboard you would like to edit.
. Select the *Edit* button at the upper right of the Liveboard. If this button is grayed out, you do not have edit privileges for the Liveboard. To resolve this, contact your administrator or the creator of the Liveboard.
. Click on the bar that appears at the top of any visualization when you hover over it. This allows you to drag and drop your visualizations to new positions in the Liveboard.
