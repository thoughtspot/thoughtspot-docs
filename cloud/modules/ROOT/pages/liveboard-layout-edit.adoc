Visualizations within a Liveboard are easy to move around and snap into place on a relative flow layout.
Your Liveboard layout is also responsive to your browser resolution.
This helps keep the layout of your Liveboard neat and organized.

== Reorder the visualizations

You can reorder the visualizations in a Liveboard by dragging and dropping them in *Edit* mode.
One Liveboard row can hold a predetermined number of visualizations of each size. To change the visualization layout, follow these steps:

. Click *Liveboards*, on the top navigation bar.
. Navigate to the Liveboard you would like to edit.
. Select the *Edit* button at the top right of the Liveboard. If this button is grayed out, you do not have edit privileges for the Liveboard. To resolve this, contact your administrator or the creator of the Liveboard.
. Click on the bar that appears at the top of any visualization when you hover over it. This allows you to drag and drop your visualizations to new positions in the Liveboard.

== Change the size of a visualization

The size picker at the bottom of a visualization's *More* menu image:icon-more-10px.png[more options menu icon] lets you toggle between predetermined sizes for each visualization. All visualizations *except headlines* have 5 size options. Headlines can only be the smallest size.

== Make a copy of a visualization from your Liveboard

You may see a visualization that you would like to edit or filter, without editing or filtering the Liveboard. To do this, you can *make a copy* of a visualization. The copy you create takes into account the Liveboard filters that apply to the visualization.

To create a copy of a visualization and edit it, follow these steps:

. Navigate to the Liveboard that contains the visualization you would like to copy and edit.
. In the upper-right corner of the visualization you would like to edit, click the *more options* icon image:icon-more-10px.png[more options menu icon].
. Select *Make a copy*.
+
A copy of the answer that created the visualization opens in a new tab, with "`Copy of`" added to the beginning of the title.

. Make any changes you want to the visualization.
. Click the *more options* icon image:icon-more-10px.png[more options menu icon] and select *Save*.
+
The Save Answer dialog box appears.

. Change the name and description, as needed, and click *Save answer*.
+
When you navigate back to the Answers page, your edited Answer appears in the list.

== Other Liveboard edits

Other Liveboard actions include actions you normally perform on your search as well as actions that you can only perform on a Liveboard.
These actions appear under the *More* menu icon image:icon-more-10px.png[more options menu icon] for the Liveboard, in *view* or *edit* mode, or under the *More* menu icon image:icon-more-10px.png[more options menu icon] for a visualization, in *view* or *edit* mode.

For example, in *View* mode for a Liveboard, the Liveboard more menu allows you to xref:liveboard-schedule.adoc[manage Liveboard schedules], xref:liveboard-download-pdf.adoc[download the Liveboard as a PDF], and so on. In *Edit* mode, the Liveboard more menu only allows you to make a copy of the Liveboard, or delete it.

In *View* mode, the visualization more menu allows you to download the visualization, analyze it with SpotIQ, and so on. In *Edit* mode, the visualization more menu only allows you to make a copy of the visualization, delete it, or change its size.
