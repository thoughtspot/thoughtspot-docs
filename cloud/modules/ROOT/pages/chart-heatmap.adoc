:description: Heatmap charts use color-coding to represent data values.
:jira: SCAL-235858

Heatmap charts are similar to xref:chart-treemap.adoc[treemap charts]: they both use a similar system of color-coding to represent data values.
However, the heatmap chart does not use size to measure data, and instead requires an additional attribute.

The value of each cell depends on the measure you choose under *Edit chart configuration*.

== Change heatmap color
By default, the heatmap color is teal in various shades. You can change the heatmap color under chart configuration. To change the basic color the heatmap uses, follow these steps:

. Navigate to any heatmap chart that you have *edit* privileges for.

. Select the *chart configuration* icon image:icon-gear-10px.png[chart configuration icon] on the left side of your screen.

. Select the chip for the measure under *Value*.

. Click the *Color* dropdown menu, and select one of the options in the color palette.

[#labels]
== Modify data labels
By default, heatmaps have data labels enabled for every value. To disable data labels for heatmaps, follow these steps:

. Navigate to the heatmap you would like to disable data labels for.
. Select the *edit chart configuration* image:icon-gear-10px.png[chart configuration icon image] icon in the upper right of your screen.
. The *Edit chart* panel opens. Select the *Settings* tab.
. Select the *All labels* option. This enables and disables data labels.

[#charts-with-gradients]
== Change chart gradient

You can now choose multiple colors to define a gradient in charts that support gradients -- geo heatmap, geo area, heatmap, and treemap charts. You can control the low, mid, and high values, and numerical value points to customize the gradient.

To define the gradient in a geo heatmap, geo area, heatmap, or treemap chart, follow these steps:

. Open your chart, click the gear icon, and select the measure tile under *Value*. In a search by sales, item type, and city, the value would be sales.

. Select *Edit* under *Gradient*.

. In the Gradient pop-up, define the colors for the *Low*, *Midpoint*, and *High* values using the color selector dropdowns.

. In the text boxes below the color selectors, you can define the low, midpoint, and high points numerically. You can define the low point, high point and midpoint as a narrow range if you would rather only see gradients for the top values of your measure.

. (Optional) Select *Flip Color* to switch the high and low value colors.

. Select *Save*.

== Limitations
Heatmap charts do *_NOT_* support conditional formatting.
