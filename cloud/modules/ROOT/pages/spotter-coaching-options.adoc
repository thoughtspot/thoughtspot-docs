At the moment, Spotter provides two different coaching options (in addition to the options already covered under data modeling):




* <<reference-questions,Reference questions>>
* <<business-terms,Business terms>>




[#reference-questions]
== Reference questions




Reference questions are just a set of sample questions and their corresponding answers (in ThoughtSpot Search xref:keywords.adoc[keyword language]).




=== How reference questions help Spotter




The reference questions provided to Spotter help it in the following ways :


Spotter provides the verified answer when users ask the same question:: The reference questions are designed in a way to provide the exact same answer when users ask the same question. We recommend adding the most commonly asked questions to reference questions so that business users get a verified answer that is curated by an analyst. +
For the questions specified under reference questions, Spotter also remembers the visualization settings set by the analyst.
+
[NOTE]
====
Reference questions are not designed to coach on visualization settings, as the specific visualization settings you apply (like chart type and axis setup) are only applied if the user's question exactly matches the reference question. Even a one-word difference means those custom chart settings won’t carry over.
====
Hence, one of the direct benefits of providing reference questions is to make sure Spotter provides an accurate response for commonly asked questions.


Spotter learns how different columns should be used to answer questions:: An indirect benefit of providing reference questions is that it helps in warming up our usage-based ranking systems. The reference questions help our system learn which columns must be selected in answering questions. +
We have observed that for newly created data sets where the usage-based ranking system isn’t warmed up, Spotter might struggle to pick the correct columns if there are similar-sounding column names. Adding reference questions coaches Spotter to understand which columns should be used for answering questions. +
//We recommend that you add reference questions that use the majority of the columns present in your Model. Ensuring a good column coverage ensures that Spotter understands when and how to use the columns available in your Model.


=== Key considerations


New data sets:: For new data sets, especially those without much usage history or existing Liveboards, reference questions are vital. They help "warm up" Spotter's understanding of which columns are most relevant for analysis, especially if column names are ambiguous


Avoid over-coaching:: Don't create too many reference questions that are extremely similar but with tiny variations in wording. This can sometimes confuse Spotter. Test Spotter with variations of a concept. If it understands them after coaching one good reference question, you don't need to add redundant examples.




==== Coaching a sales metric


Let’s say you want to train Spotter on a specific question, “What is the sales for Eastern stores this month?”
You want Spotter to understand this as `Sum Order_Amount` where `region = ‘East’` and `order_date = this month`.


From this, Spotter might learn to associate:
“sales” with the `Order_Amount` column (and the general intention of total sales while referring to sales).
“Eastern stores” with the `region= ‘East’` column .
“order_date” for queries referring to sales topics.
Once coached with this reference question, Spotter should ideally also respond correctly to variations like:
"Sales for the West this month?"
"How much did we sell in the North this year?"
Key point to note: Always test these variations. For terms that always need a specific mapping (like "sales" always meaning `sum(Order_Amount)`), using a business term is often a better approach.




=== Guidelines for reference questions




Add commonly-asked questions in reference questions:: Spotter provides the answer you have curated when a user asks the same question. Hence, we recommend that you add the most commonly-asked questions by the business user as reference questions so that users get a verified answer every time they ask these questions.


Coached question templates:: You should think of reference questions as coached question templates. For example, once you have provided “What is the sales for east this month ?” as a reference question, then Spotter has the ability to generalize the learnings from this question to answer similar questions like “What is the sales for west this month ?” , “What are the sales for north this year ?” , “What is the quantity sold for east this week?”, etc..
+
NOTE: Please note that the visualization settings provided in query coaching may not extend to these questions. Visualization settings don't apply if the question is different from the reference question.


Ensure good column coverage:: As mentioned above, Spotter learns how to use columns for analysis when they are used in reference questions. Hence, we recommend that you provide enough reference questions so that all the important columns in your Models are represented in the reference questions. +
For newly created data sets with no Liveboards, the reference questions play an extremely critical role in coaching Spotter.








[#business-terms]
== Business terms




Business terms give you an option to create a mapping between your data and the business term/vocabulary used in day-to-day operations.




=== How business terms help Spotter




Business terms are a mapping of the data to the vocabulary used by the business users in day-to-day life. Every business has its own definition of various metrics and a very specific way for calculating these metrics. Business terms allow an analyst to add these mappings to the Spotter knowledge to ensure that the LLM uses your definition of a metric instead of making assumptions to calculate these metrics.


We recommend using business terms for providing the following types of knowledge to Spotter :


Define how to calculate certain metrics:: In order to answer questions, you sometimes need to generate calculated fields or metrics. You can use the business term to teach the Spotter on how to calculate specific metrics for your business. Spotter learns how you calculate specific metrics and it has the ability to extrapolate these learnings to different scenarios.


Define synonyms for column values:: Often, the same value might be referred to with different names. We recommend the use of business terms to define the synonyms for value. *While Spotter has the ability to apply semantic matches based on publicly-known information*, there are always some cases where you want to define synonyms or acronyms which are only applicable to your own business and cannot be guessed by a large language model.


Filters definition:: Business terms can be used to define filters that should be applied for specific cases.




=== Guidelines for business terms




Our system suggests business terms to you when you are coaching Spotter for reference questions or correcting the answer during conversation. You must only add business terms which meet the following criteria :


Meaningful addition to Spotter knowledge:: The first thing you should evaluate is whether adding the business terms will lead to a meaningful addition to Spotter knowledge about your data. Anything which is obvious or common knowledge can already be guessed by the LLM models as they are coached on a large corpus of public data sets. Hence, try to avoid adding the definition for commonly available terms in business terms, as the LLM will already provide correct responses.
+
Business terms are most helpful for addition of definitions which are specific to your organization and cannot be guessed by business users. These are the business terms which will provide a meaningful addition to Spotter knowledge.
+
Note there are terms like “sales contribution” which may seem fairly obvious at first, however, when you deep-dive into specifics of calculating it, you will realize that the way your business computes this is very specific. Hence, we recommend that you provide some sample to Spotter to ensure these definitions are calculated according to your business requirements only.


Hold the same meaning in all contexts:: Business terms, once defined, are considered to apply uniformly across all the question contexts. You must only use business terms for adding analytical definitions for the terms which hold the same meaning in all the different contexts it can be used for that Model. +
You should avoid addition of business terms just to coach Spotter on handling date intents better because in most data sets there may be more than one date column, and once you have used business terms to define date intent (for example, this year → `created_date.this year`), then Spotter might start using the same definition when `this year` is used in a different context.


Business terms and their analytical definition are correct:: You should only accept the business terms whose analytical definition (represented by ThoughtSpot keyword-based search tokens) is correct.

[#coaching-strategy]
== Coaching strategy: How many examples and when?

This subsection addresses common strategic questions about the necessity and quantity of coaching examples to help you coach effectively.
If Spotter already answers a question correctly, should I still coach for it?:: Consider the data model's obviousness:
If the correct interpretation is truly straightforward and evident from your well-optimized data model::: For example, if a user asks "show me the sales?" or "what is the revenue?" and there's only one clear sales or revenue column that Spotter easily and correctly uses), then specific coaching (like a reference question) for this exact query is likely unnecessary.
If you, as the coach, feel the correct interpretation isn't immediately obvious from the data model alone, even if Spotter happens to get it right::: Sometimes, you might want to reinforce a fundamental interpretation, especially if it involves a subtle but important nuance. Think of it like onboarding a new analyst; you might state a basic principle once to ensure it's understood as a standard.
For instance, a query like "show me the sales for x region last month?" might be a good candidate for a reference question, not just to get the answer right, but to explicitly teach Spotter which specific date column (for example, `Order Date` vs. `Ship Date`) should be contextually used with the sales measure when a time filter like "last month" is applied for that type of regional sales query.


When to lean towards coaching (even if Spotter seems correct)::
For highly critical, foundational queries::: If a question is extremely common and vital, creating a reference question acts as a "gold standard" to lock in its interpretation.


To teach nuances and associations::: Use reference questions to guide Spotter on specific associations, like the correct date column to use with a particular measure in a certain context.


To "Warm Up" New Datasets::: For new datasets, a few reference questions for common queries help establish initial patterns for Spotter and help associate columns with particular keywords.


Key Caution;; While you might reinforce some basics, do not add too many obvious or overlapping coaching examples. Ensure that the concepts being coached in each piece of coaching are distinct and avoid introducing conflicting instructions. The goal is to clarify, not to confuse with excessive or redundant coaching.


How many similar Reference Question examples are required? / How many variations should I add?::
Quality over quantity::: Aim to teach Spotter _concepts_ and _patterns_, not every conceivable way a question can be phrased.


Start minimally::: For a given _type_ of query or analytical concept, begin by creating just one to two high-quality reference questions that clearly demonstrate the desired interpretation and outcome.


Test generalization (with an example):::
After providing your initial one to two examples, actively test if Spotter can generalize this learning to similar but uncoached questions.
Example using a coaching scope:
Suppose you've added a reference question for: "What is the revenue generated this quarter?"
(Spotter learns to map "revenue" to `SUM(Amount)` where `Status='booked'` and "this quarter" to the correct date logic on `Close Date`).
You also add a reference question for: "What is the revenue generated by Region?" (Spotter learns how to use the "revenue" logic and group it by the `Region` column).
Now, test generalization by asking a combined, uncoached question: "What is the revenue generated by Sector this quarter?" or "Show revenue by Department last month."
Evaluate:
If Spotter correctly applies the "revenue" logic, grouped by the new dimension (`Sector` or `Department`), and correctly applies the new time filter ("this quarter" or "last month"), then generalization is working well. You likely _don't_ need to create explicit reference questions for every combination of metric, dimension, and time filter.
If Spotter fails on the combined question, analyze why. Did the initial examples not clearly isolate the concepts? Or is a specific term like "revenue" itself better defined as a robust business term for absolute consistency of the core metric before testing such combinations?


When to add more:: Only consider adding another reference question example if testing reveals that Spotter consistently fails to generalize for a common and important variation, and you believe an additional example will clarify a specific pattern or nuance that was missed.
