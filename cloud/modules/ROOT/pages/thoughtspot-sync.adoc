:description: You can use ThoughtSpot Sync to sync data to a third-party business application workspaces such as Slack, Google Sheets, and Microsoft Teams.

You can now sync data directly from an Answer or a custom SQL view, to an external business app. Using ThoughtSpot Sync, you can push insights directly to your app, notify your teams, and view data in context. ThoughtSpot automatically establishes a secure pipeline to the destination app and thus eliminates the need for building custom connectors to external apps. You can quickly get started and push data to your workspace with a few simple steps.

NOTE: ThoughtSpot Sync is not supported for Answers v1 or Liveboards v1. To enable Sync, select the user icon in the upper-right corner of the menu bar, and set *Answer experience* and *Liveboards experience* to "New experience".

== ThoughtSpot Sync homepage

From the Data Workspace, you can access ThoughtSpot Sync to view and create new destinations, schedule syncing of output from SQL views or Answers, manage pipelines, and view sync activity for your team. To navigate to the ThoughtSpot Sync page, click the *Data* tab and select *Sync* from the menu on the left.

NOTE: Only users with admin privileges see the syncs and pipelines created by other users in their group. Users without admin privileges see only the syncs and pipelines they personally create.

=== Destinations

From the *Destinations* tab, you can add a new destination and view existing destinations created by your team. A destination defines the business app you connect to and the authorized user creating the connection. To create a new destination, select the tile with the name of the external app you want to sync to.

To edit, reauthorize, or delete a pipeline, scroll through the destinations list and select the *more options* menu icon image:icon-more-10px.png[more options menu icon] to the left of the pipeline author name. Note that existing pipelines may break when you reauthorize the destination.

[#pipelines]
=== Pipelines

A pipeline defines the data sent to a specific destination from an Answer or view. To create a new pipeline from the *Pipelines* tab, select the *Create new pipeline* button.

From the *Pipelines* tab, you can see a list of pipelines created by your team, and the defining characteristics of each. You can use the *Sources* and *Destinations* fields to the left of the search bar to filter through the list, or search by name in the search bar. Note that scheduled syncs are defined as schedules under the *Run type*, and display the frequency at which they repeat under *Frequency*.

NOTE: Any sync over 50,000 rows may result in an execution timeout. For optimal performance, keep your sync to below 50,000 rows. If you're syncing a large number of rows and the sync fails, try applying filters like date filters to make your dataset smaller and then sync.


To edit, delete, sync immediately, or view run history of a certain pipeline, find the pipeline name in the list and select the *more options* menu icon image:icon-more-10px.png[more options menu icon] to the right of the pipeline *Frequency*.

Note that when you create a new pipeline, you can use the icons displayed in the *Source* dropdown menu to determine the format of your source. Answers are shown with a pie-chart icon image:icon-pie-chart.png[answer icon], while SQL views display a SQL icon image:icon-sql.png[SQL view icon], and search-based views display an article icon image:icon-article.png[search-based view icon].

=== Activity

Use the *Activity* tab to view the run history of all pipelines. You can see the pipeline source type, run type, start and end time, number of rows sent, sync status, and activity log. Select *Activity log* to see more information about the syncâ€™s run, or to download the log file.
