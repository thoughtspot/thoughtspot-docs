:description: You can use ThoughtSpot Sync to sync data to a third-party business application workspaces such as Slack, Google Sheets, and Microsoft Teams.

You can now sync data directly from an answer or a custom SQL view, to an external business app. Using ThoughtSpot Sync, you can push insights directly to your app, notify your teams, and view data in context. ThoughtSpot automatically establishes a secure pipeline to the destination app and thus eliminates the need for building custom connectors to external apps. You can quickly get started and push data to your workspace with a few simple steps.

NOTE: ThoughtSpot Sync is not supported for Answers v1 or Liveboards v1. To enable Sync, click the user icon in the upper right corner of the menu bar, and set *Answer experience* and *Liveboards experience* to "New experience".

== ThoughtSpot Sync homepage

From the Data Workspace, you can access ThoughtSpot Sync to view and create new destinations,
//schedule syncing of output from SQL views or answers,
manage pipelines, and view sync activity for your team. To navigate to the ThoughtSpot Sync page, click on the *Data* tab and select *Sync* from the menu on the left.

NOTE: Only users with admin privileges see the syncs and pipelines created by other users in their group. Users without admin privileges see only the syncs and pipelines they personally create.

=== Destinations

From the *Destinations* tab, you can add a new destination and view existing destinations created by your team. A destination defines the business app you connect to and the authorized user creating the connection. To create a new destination, select the tile with the name of the external app you want to sync to.

To edit, reauthorize, or delete a pipeline, scroll through the destinations list and select the *more options* menu icon image:icon-more-10px.png[] to the left of the pipeline author name. Note that existing pipelines may break when you reauthorize the destination.

=== Pipelines

A pipeline defines the data sent to a specific destination from an answer or view. To create a new pipeline from the *Pipelines* tab, select the *Create new pipeline* button.

To edit, delete, sync immediately, or view run history of a certain pipeline, find the pipeline name in the list and select the *more options* menu icon image:icon-more-10px.png[] to the right of the pipeline *Frequency*. You can use the *Sources* and *Destinations* fields to the left of the search bar to filter through the list, or search by name in the search bar.

Note that when you create a new pipeline, you can use the icons displayed in the *Source* drop-down to determine the format of your source. Answers are shown with a pie-chart icon, while SQL views display a SQL icon, and Sage views display an article icon.
