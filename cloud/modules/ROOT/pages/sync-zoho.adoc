== Sync to {connection} from an Answer

To create a sync to {connection} from an Answer, follow these steps:

+
NOTE: You cannot create a sync from an unsaved Answer. If the *Sync to other apps* option appears grayed-out in the menu, first save the Answer before trying again.

. If this is the first sync you have created for {connection}, a pop-up authorization window appears. To give ThoughtSpot permission to send data to your {connection} account, enter your email or phone number, click *Next*, enter your password, and select *Sign in*. Click *Accept* to allow ThoughtSpot to access data in your Zoho account.
