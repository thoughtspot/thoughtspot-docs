== Sync to {connection} from an Answer

To create a sync to {connection} from an Answer, follow these steps:

. Select the desired Answer from the *Answers* tab or the ThoughtSpot homepage. You must have *Can manage sync* permissions and *view* access to an Answer to create a sync.

. In the upper-right corner of the Answer, click the *more options* menu icon image:icon-more-10px.png[More options menu icon]. From the dropdown menu, select *Sync to other apps*, then choose *{connection}*.
+
//NOTE: You cannot create a sync from an unsaved Answer. If the *Sync to other apps* option appears grayed-out in the menu, first save the Answer before trying again.

. If this is the first sync you have created for {connection}, a pop-up authorization window appears. To give ThoughtSpot permission to send data to your {connection} account, enter your email or phone number, click *Next*, enter your password, and select *Sign in*. Click *Accept* to allow ThoughtSpot to access data in your Zoho account.

. Within ThoughtSpot, fill in the following parameters:

* Edit the *Pipeline name* if needed. By default, this field populates with _PL-[Answer Name]_.
* If you have more than one {connection} destination set up, then the *Destination* field appears, and you will have to select a {connection} destination from the dropdown menu available. However, if no destinations have been set up before or if you have only one {connection} destination, the *Destination* field will not appear.
* Select your {connection} *Object* from the dropdown menu. You can choose between *Accounts*, *Contacts*, *Deals*, and *Leads*.
* Select *Operation* from the dropdown menu. You can choose between *Create*, *Update*, and *Delete*.

* Map the *Source* and *Destination* columns from the dropdown menus provided. Note that the Source column refers to the column in ThoughtSpot, while the Destination column refers to the column in {connection}.

. By default, “Save and sync” is selected. Select *Save* to send your data to {connection}. Your data immediately appears in {connection}.

. [Optional] To set up a repeated sync, click *Schedule your sync* and select your timezone. From the options provided, choose whether the sync will occur every:

* _n_ minutes. You can choose to schedule a sync every 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, or 45 minutes.
* _n_ hours.
* _n_ days at a selected time. Note that you can choose not to send an update on weekends.
* week at a selected time and day.
* _n_ months at a selected time and date.

NOTE: Any sync over 50,000 rows may result in an execution timeout. For optimal performance, keep your sync to below 50,000 rows. If you're syncing a large number of rows and the sync fails, try applying filters like date filters to make your dataset smaller and then sync.


== Sync to {connection} from a Custom SQL View

To sync to {connection} from a custom SQL view, follow these steps:

. Navigate to your SQL view by selecting the *Data* tab and searching from the Data Workspace home page. Select the SQL view name.

.  If this is the first sync you have created for the selected app, an authorization page appears. To give ThoughtSpot permission to send data to your {connection} account, enter your email or phone number, click *Next*, and select *Accept*.


. Fill in the following parameters:

* Edit the *Pipeline name* if needed. By default, this field populates with _PL-[Answer Name]_.

=== Manage pipelines

While you can also manage a pipeline from the *Pipelines* tab in the Data Workspace, accessing the *Manage pipelines* option from an Answer or view displays all pipelines local to that specific data object. To manage a pipeline from an Answer or view, follow these steps:

. Click the *more options* menu icon image:icon-more-10px.png[more options menu icon] and select *Manage pipelines*.

. Scroll to the name of your pipeline from the list that appears. Next to the pipeline name, select the *more options* icon image:icon-more-10px.png[more options menu icon]. From the list that appears, select:

* *Edit* to edit the pipeline’s properties. For example, for a pipeline to Google Sheets, you can edit the pipeline name, file name, sheet name, or cell number. Note that you cannot edit the source or destination of a pipeline.
* *Delete* to permanently delete the pipeline.
* *Sync now* to sync your Answer or view to the designated destination.
* *View run history* to see the pipeline’s Activity log in the Data Workspace.
