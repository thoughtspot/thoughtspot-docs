Once ThoughtSpot Connections is enabled, you can add a connection to a {connection} database.
This allows you to perform a live query of the external database to create Answers and Liveboards, without having to bring the data into ThoughtSpot.

NOTE: Mode connector is in Early Access and off by default. To enable it, contact your administrator.

== Prerequisites

Before you create a connection to Mode, you must first create an API credential. To create a new API token, you must have a paid Mode plan and Admin access. Follow these steps:

. Enter {connection} and select *Workspace settings* from the left menu.

. Select *Default Settings*.

. Click *API* in the top menu.

. Select the cog icon to the right of *Workspace API Tokens* and click *Create new API token*.

. Enter a display name and save the token. You will need the API token and secret to create your connection in ThoughtSpot.

== Connect to ThoughtSpot

To add a connection to {connection}:

. Select *Data* in the top navigation bar.
. Open the *Connections* tab in the left navigation bar, and select the *Others* tile. Alternatively, select *+ Create new* in the left navigation bar, select *Connection*, and select the {connection} tile.
. Create a name for your connection, a description (optional), then select the {connection} connection type, and select *Continue*.

. Enter the connection details for your {connection} data source.
+
For Host, enter `production-datawarehouse.mode.com`, and for Port, enter `8444`.
+
Note that you will use the API token as the user name and the secret as the password.
+

+
Refer to the xref:connections-mode-reference.adoc[{connection} connection reference] for more information on each of the specific attributes you must enter for your connection.

. (Optional) Provide additional key-value pairs that you need to set up your connection to {connection} or customize additional JDBC parameters supported by {connection}, by doing the following:
.. Select the *Advanced Config* menu to reveal the *Key* and *Value* fields.
.. Enter your key and value information.
.. To add more keys and values, select the plus sign (+), and enter them.
+
We recommend using the following key-value pair:

Key:: useSystemTrustStore
Value:: false
+
[NOTE]
====
Any key-value pairs that you enter must be defined in your Mode data source.
Key-value pairs are case-sensitive.

====

. Select *Continue*.
. Select tables (on the left) and the columns from each table (on the right), and then select *Create connection*.
+

+
Once the connection is added, you can search your {connection} database right away by selecting *Search now*.
+
Your new connection appears on the *Data* > *Connections* page.
Select the name of your connection to view the tables and columns in your connection.

The connection you just created is a link to the external data source.
If there are any joins in the selected tables of the external data source, those are imported into ThoughtSpot.

You can now perform a live query on the selected tables and columns of your connection.
Because the selected tables and columns in your connection are linked, it may take a while to initially render the search results.
This is because ThoughtSpot does not cache linked data.
With linked data, ThoughtSpot queries the external database directly, which is slower than querying data that is stored in ThoughtSpot's database.

== Share a connection

Users with *can manage data* or *admin* privileges can share connections with other users or groups that have *can manage data* privileges. Once granted access to a connection, users can add, remove, and modify tables in that connection.

To share a connection with another user, follow these steps:

. Navigate to the *Data* tab and select *Connections*.

. Select the checkbox next to the name of the connection you want to share, and click *Share*.

. In the *Share connection* dialog, enter the ID of the user or group you want to share the connection with. You can use the search bar to find the user or group.

. Select *Done*.

Note that to remove share access from a connection, you must navigate to the *Share connection* dialog and select *Remove access* to the left of the user group or name.

== Troubleshooting

If you run into an error while creating a {connection} connection, try making the following adjustments:

* Under *Advanced Configuration*, enter the following key-value pair:
** key: encrypt
** value: true

* Make sure that the database listed is the internal database name.
