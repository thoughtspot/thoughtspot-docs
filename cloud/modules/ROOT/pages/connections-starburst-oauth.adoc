:description: Learn how to configure OAuth for a Starburst connection in ThoughtSpot.

ThoughtSpot supports OAuth for a {connection} connection.

To configure OAuth for {connection}, you create an app in the Identity Provider and use the app’s credentials to register it in {connection} as an external token provider. Once these steps are completed, {connection} will allow connections coming in with the JWT issued by the IdP.

NOTE: The steps provided here are an example of how you can configure Okta for external OAuth. You can use any OAuth flow provided that you can get the information required for the security integration. The following steps provide a guide for getting the information required to create the security integration for Snowflake.

IMPORTANT: Be sure to consult your organization's security policies for configuring an authorization server to make sure you meet all requirements.

[#part-1]
== Part 1: Configuring the IdP with Okta

The following steps detail the configuration of IdP with Okta as an example. You can set up any other OpenID Connect (OIDC)-based IdP providers following a similar process. For details, refer to the respective documentation for those.

To configure the IdP with Okta, do the following:

. Log in to the Okta console with a user having administrator privileges. Navigate to the *Applications* page in the console and click *Create App Integration*.

+
. For sign-in method, choose *OIDC - OpenID Connect*.
. For application type, choose *Web Application*
. Click *Next*.
. Under Grant type, make sure *Authorization Code* and *Refresh Token* are selected.

. For Sign-in redirect URIs, add the ThoughtSpot redirect URI for the application.
+
It should follow this format:
+
`\https://<your-thoughtspot-instance-host>/callosum/v1/connection/generateTokens`
+

. Assign the application to everyone in the organization or to specific groups. This step may vary for other IdPs.

. Collect the client credentials from the application home page and make a note of them. These will be required later for adding the external token provider in {connection}.

. Go to menu:Security[API], and make a note of the value for Audience. This is required in a later step
for configuring the OpenID well-known URI for the authorization server.
+

+
For Okta, it should follow this format:
+
`\https://<organization>.okta..com/oauth2/<unique_id>/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`
. Open the URL in a browser and make a note of the values for the following parameters:
- Issuer
- Authorization endpoint
- JWKS URI
- Token endpoint

== Part 2: Adding external token provider in {connection}

To add an external token provider in {connection}, do the following:

- From the installation folder, open `<install_dir>/etc/config.properties` and add the following properties:
+
[source]
----
http-server.authentication.type=PASSWORD,JWT
http-server.authentication.jwt.key-file=<value of jwks_uri from open id config>
http-server.authentication.jwt.required-issuer=<value of issuer from open id config>
http-server.authentication.jwt.required-audience=<value of audience frmo open id config>
http-server.authentication.jwt.principal-field=<value of the claim containing the user name>
----
+
These details should be obtained from the well known open id configuration URL obtained from Okta authorization server (e.g. *\https://example.okta.com/oauth2/abc1234xyz/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server*).
+
The value for the principal-field configuration should be the claim name in the JWT that contains the username matching the username created in Starburst. This can be found from the token payload. In the below example the username is in the claim “sub”
