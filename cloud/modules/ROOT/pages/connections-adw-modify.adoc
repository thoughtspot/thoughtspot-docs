To remove a table from a connection, delete it from the connection details page. For more information, see: <<deleting-a-table-from-an-oracle-adw-connection,Delete a table from an ADW connection>>.

[#remapping-an-oracle-adw-connection]
== Remapping an Oracle ADW connection

Modify the connection parameters by editing the source mapping `yaml` file that was created when you added the connection. For example, you can remap the existing table or column to a different table or column in an existing database connection. ThoughtSpot recommends that you check the dependencies before and after you remap a table or column in a connection to ensure they display as intended.

To remap a connection:

. Click *Data* in the top navigation bar.

. Click the *Connections* tab at the top of the page.

. Click the name of the connection you want to remap.

. Click the More Info icon image:icon-ellipses.png[] and select *Remapping* on the upper-right-hand side of the page.
+

. Click *Download* to download the source mapping file.

. Edit the file, as required, and save it.

. Finally, click *Browse your files*, and upload your edited mapping file to update the mapping of your connection.

[#removing-a-column-from-an-oracle-adw-connection]
== Removing a column from an Oracle ADW connection

You can edit an Oracle ADW connection to remove a column.

To remove a column from an Oracle ADW connection:

. Click *Data* in the top navigation bar.

. Click the *Connections* tab.

. Click the name of the connection that contains the column you want to remove.

[#deleting-a-table-from-an-oracle-adw-connection]
== Deleting a table from an Oracle ADW connection

ThoughtSpot checks for dependencies whenever you try to remove a table in a connection. ThoughtSpot shows a list of dependent objects, and you can click them to delete them or remove the dependency. Then you can remove the table.

To delete a table:

. Click *Data* in the top navigation bar.

. Click the *Connections* tab.

. Click the name of the connection that contains the table you want to delete.

. Find the table you want to delete in the list, and check the box next to its name.

. Click *Delete*, and then click *Delete again* to confirm.

If you attempt to delete a table with dependent objects, the operation is blocked. A Cannot delete window appears, with a list of links to dependent objects. See <<deleting-a-table-with-dependent-objects,Deleting a table with dependent objects>>.

[#deleting-a-table-with-dependent-objects]
=== Deleting a table with dependent objects

- In the _Cannot delete_ window, click the link for each object to modify or delete it.
+

You can also click the name of a table and then click the linked objects to see a list of dependent objects with links. The list shows the names of the dependent objects (worksheets, pinboards or answers), and the columns they use from that table. You can use this information to determine the impact of changing the structure of the data source or to see how widely used it is. Click a dependent object to modify or delete it.

When all dependencies are removed, you can delete the table.

[#deleting-an-oracle-adw-connection]
