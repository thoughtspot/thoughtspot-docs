:description: You can share Views with users or with groups. Sharing a View allows users to select it as a data source and search it.

When you share a View, you share all of its data.
Sharing a View does not share the underlying tables.
If you want to share the underlying tables, see xref:share-source-tables.adoc#[Sharing tables and columns].
A View can be shared by the owner of the View, or by an administrator.
Users can start searching a View as soon as the View is shared with them.

You can share a View from the the list of Views under *Views* <<share-datatab,on the *Data* tab>>, or from <<share-dataset,the View itself>>.
