There are several system monitoring Liveboards in ThoughtSpot that provide answers for system status and resource usage questions.

Only users with administrative privilege can view the monitoring Liveboards.
They are based on xref:system-worksheet.adoc[system worksheets and views], which administrators can view, but not modify.
