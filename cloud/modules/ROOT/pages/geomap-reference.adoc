:description: ThoughtSpot recognizes and supports a broad list of geographic regions and their subdivisions.
:page-aliases: /reference/geomap-reference.adoc
:experimental:
:jira: SCAL-195134

This reference lists supported countries and their subdivisions for Worksheets with the geographical data manually classified.

[#enhancement]
As of 9.4.0.cl, geographical data is classified as *Auto select*, and we have added support for all countries. For a full list, see link:https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/List_of_territory_based_projects[Openstreetmap supported countries]. If you would like to use a custom map to visualize your data, see xref:geomaps-custom.adoc[].

Previously, ThoughtSpot supported the following geo chart capabilities:

* Visualize data at the country level for multiple countries in one chart.
* Visualize data at a higher level of detail (state, city, zip code) within one country at a time.
Now, ThoughtSpot supports the following capabilities:

* Visualizations comparing subdivisions of multiple countries in a single visualization. For example, if a selected column contains data from cities in the United States and Mexico, all data would be displayed on a single visualization.
* Visualizations displaying multiple levels of subdivisions within a country, rather than just city and zip code.
* Visualizations representing zip code as an area within a region, rather than a point on a map.
To improve the accuracy of your Search, we recommend appending the country name, or adding a reference to the country that the data is referring to. To append the country name, you can use a formula such as `concat (region, ', ' , country)`.

When manually selecting the type of geographical data in a Worksheet, you may have to make changes to your data to support geo maps.
For example, you may be collecting data for locations in Washington County, Alabama, and also for locations in Washington County, Wisconsin.
According to the 2010 Census, there are 31 distinct Washington Counties in the United States.
To account for multiple different geographical entities with the same name, you must be specific within your data.
A value of _Washington County_ without a state attached to it may result in incorrect or incomplete geo maps.

== Download the supported geo maps CSV file

You can download a CSV file that contains all supported values for geo map countries, codes, and subdivisions in Worksheets with geographical data manually classified.. Use this file to confirm that your own geographical values are in the correct format, and that ThoughtSpot supports them. Download the link:{attachmentsdir}/geomaps-supported-countries-codes-subdivisions-cloud.csv[CSV file].

NOTE: The CSV file contains leading 0s when these zeros are present for ThoughtSpot at the beginning of zip/post code values. This includes post or zip codes for Australia, Germany, Italy, Norway, and the United States. However, if you import this file into Excel or another spreadsheet tool, that tool may remove leading zeros, resulting in data that does not match ThoughtSpot's format.
