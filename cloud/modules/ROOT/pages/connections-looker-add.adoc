:description: Learn how to add a Looker Modeler connection.
:jira: SCAL-161198

== Prerequisites

The following are required to create a {connection} connection:

- A Looker (original) instance hosted on Google Cloud, running Looker 23.14 or later.
+
This connector is available for Looker (Google Cloud Core) instances with Looker version 23.18
ThoughtSpot is compatible with the most recent version of Lookerâ€™s JDBC driver.
- A Looker model that uses BigQuery as its data source.
- ThoughtSpot administrator must do the following:
* Contact Looker administrator to enable support for ThoughtSpot in {connection}.
* Contact {support-url} to enable support for {connection} in your ThoughtSpot cluster.
- User creating a {connection} connection must have:
* The same email address in both {connection} and ThoughtSpot.
* Access to explores in {connection}.
* _Can manage data_ permission in ThoughtSpot.

== Connecting to {connection}

To connect to {connection}, follow these steps:

. Select *Data* in the top navigation bar.
. Open the *Connections* tab in the left navigation bar, and select the *Others* tile. Alternatively, select *+ Create new* in the left navigation bar, select *Connection*, and select the {connection} tile.
+
// ![Click "+ Add connection"]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/redshift-addconnection.png "Click "+ add connection"")
+
// ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/new-connection.png "New db connect")
. Create a name for your connection, a description (optional), then select the {connection} connection type, and click *Continue*.
+

. Enter the connection details for your {connection} data source using either OAuth or service account authentication.
+
For OAuth authentication, do the following:

.. Enter Host, OAuth Client ID, Scope, Auth Url, Access token Url, and Database.
+

+
For service account authentication, do the following:

** Enter Host, Password, and User.
+

+
Refer to the xref:connections-looker-reference.adoc[{connection} connection reference] for more information on each of the specific attributes you must enter for your connection.
. Ignore the *Advanced Config* menu. No configuration is needed for {connection}.

. Select *Continue*.
. Choose the explores you want to use in ThoughtSpot.
. Select explores (on the left) and the columns from each explore (on the right), and then select *Create connection*.
+
IMPORTANT: Explores appear as tables in ThoughtSpot.
+
image::snowflake-selecttables.png[Select tables and columns for your connection]
// ![Select tables and columns for your connection]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/Trino-selecttables.png "Select tables and columns for your connection")
+
A message appears indicating the number of tables and columns that will be added to your connection.

. Select *Confirm*.
+
Once the connection is added, you can search right away by selecting *Search now*.
// +
// image::starburst-connectioncreated.png[The "Connection created" screen]
+
Your new connection appears on the *Data* > *Connections* page.
Select the name of your connection to view the tables and columns in your connection.

The connection you just created is a link to the external data source.

You can now perform a live query on the selected tables and columns of your connection.
Because the selected tables and columns in your connection are linked, it may take a while to initially render the search results.
This is because ThoughtSpot does not cache linked data.
With linked data, ThoughtSpot queries the external database directly, which is slower than querying data that is stored in ThoughtSpot's database.

Columns retain the same name as in {connection}, so when you create a worksheet, ThoughtSpot recommends editing the column names (as needed) to make them more user friendly. This, along with adding synonyms and descriptions to important columns, enhances their searchability in ThoughtSpot.

WARNING: Joins between explores are not supported, so when creating a worksheet, only choose one table.

You can modify a {connection} connection in the following ways:

* xref:connections-looker-edit.adoc[Edit a {connection} connection]
* xref:connections-looker-remap.adoc[Remap a {connection} connection]
* xref:connections-looker-delete-table.adoc[Delete a table from a {connection} connection]
* xref:connections-looker-delete-table-dependencies.adoc[Delete a table with dependent objects]

You can also xref:connections-mysql-delete.adoc[Delete a {connection} connection].

See the xref:connections-mysql-reference.adoc[Connection reference] for details of connection parameters.

== Share a connection

Users with *can manage data* or *admin* privileges can share connections with other users or groups that have *can manage data* privileges. Once granted access to a connection, users can add, remove, and modify tables in that connection.

To share a connection with another user, follow these steps:

. Navigate to the *Data* tab and select *Connections*.

. Select the checkbox next to the name of the connection you want to share, and click *Share*.

. In the *Share connection* dialog, enter the ID of the user or group you want to share the connection with. You can use the search bar to find the user or group.

. Select *Done*.

Note that to remove share access from a connection, you must navigate to the *Share connection* dialog and select *Remove access* to the left of the user group or name.
