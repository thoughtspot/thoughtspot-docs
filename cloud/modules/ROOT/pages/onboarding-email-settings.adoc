:description: Manage email and onboarding settings for your organization from the Admin Console.


Manage email and onboarding settings for your organization from the Admin Console.

You can manage certain advanced settings for your organization from the Admin Console.
This includes customizing welcome emails, scheduled emails, and the workflow that allows users to sign up for ThoughtSpot from the login page.

NOTE: If your organization uses xref:orgs-overview.adoc[multi-tenancy with Orgs], you must be a cluster administrator to manage these settings, not an Org administrator. You manage these settings for the whole cluster. You cannot set them separately for each Org.

Navigate to the Admin Console by selecting the *Admin* tab from the top navigation bar.
Select *Onboarding* from the side navigation bar that appears.

If your organization uses xref:orgs-overview.adoc[multi-tenancy with Orgs], ensure that you are in the Primary Org, in the *All orgs* section of the Admin Console. You manage email and onboarding settings for the whole cluster. You cannot set them separately for each Org.

You can update various <<email,email>> and <<signup,signup>> settings from this page.

NOTE: Changing these settings results in a service interruption for all users for approximately 2 minutes.
To minimize disruption, consider making your changes during a scheduled maintenance window.
