:description: Manage users in ThoughtSpot.

[NOTE]
====
This article contains instructions for managing users if your company uses the xref:orgs-overview.adoc[Orgs] feature for multi-tenancy in ThoughtSpot. If you have an Org switcher to the left of the help icon in the top navigation bar, your company is using Orgs.

If you do not have an Org switcher between the help icon and the *Search answers and Liveboards* search box, your company is *_not_* using Orgs. Refer to xref:admin-portal-users.adoc[].
====

Depending on whether you are a cluster administrator or an Org administrator, you have different levels of administrator access. Cluster administrators can see and manage users in any Org; Org administrators can only see and manage users in the Org(s) for which they are admins.

== Manage users

To manage users, you must ensure that you are either in the correct Org. If you are a cluster administrator, you can manage all users in all Orgs from the Primary Org. If you are an Org administrator, you must navigate to the specific Org the users you must manage are in. Use the Org Switcher to the left of the help menu in the top navigation bar.

Navigate to the Admin Console by clicking on the *Admin* tab from the top navigation bar. If you are a cluster administrator in the Primary Org, select *All orgs* from the side navigation bar.

Select *Users* from the side navigation bar.

You can use the Admin Console to accomplish the following tasks:

* *Create a user* by clicking on the *+ add user* button
* *Manage an existing user* by clicking on the user you would like to edit: change the username, display name, sharing visibility, password, or email, or resend or test the welcome email
* *Delete a user* by hovering over a username, clicking the checkbox that appears, and selecting the *Delete* button
* *Add a user or users to groups* by hovering over a username, clicking the checkbox that appears, and selecting the *Add users to groups* button
