This example will walk you through how to create a funnel chart, which is great for capturing and tracking stages in a process.


1. Add a discrete field to *Rows*. This field should represent the various stages of a process that you’re trying to track.

2. Add a continuous, aggregated field to *Columns*. This is the metric that you’re tracking in your funnel analysis.

3. Create a calculated field that is the negative of the metric above, and add this calculated field to *Columns* above the previous metric. This is used to mirror the values of your metric.

4. If it isn’t already, make sure to set your Mark Type to `Bar` because you want your data to be plotted as bars.

5. Sort your visualization based on the descending values of your metric.

6. Optionally, you can add a field to the *Color* channel to distinctly color stages in your funnel and add labels to showcase specific values.
