== Overview

The Discovery API is a read-only batch API that allow developers to get lists of {product} resources, along with metadata about each of those resources.
The API will be referred to as 'batch' throughout the documentation.
//See the full documentation for the Discovery API link:https://mode.com/developer/discovery-api/introduction/[here,window=_blank].

//NOTE: The Discovery API is only available for Enterprise tier customers. Reach out to your CSM to get access.

== Authentication and authorization

To return a valid signature token (to then be used for Batch API requests) send a POST request.
`signature_token` should be a top-level key in the raw data sent.

* `name` is required to be a string between 4-64 characters long.
* `expires_at` must be in ISO8601 (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mmZ) format.
* `auth_scope` must be a JSON object.
 ** `authentication_for` and `authorization_type` are the only valid keys.
  *** `batch-api` is the only valid value for `authentication_for`.
  *** `read-only` is the only valid value for `authorization_type`.
