:description: Manage users in ThoughtSpot.

Before people can sign in and use ThoughtSpot, you need to create a username, a password, and a membership in one or more groups for them.
Use the Admin Console to easily create and manage your users.

[NOTE]
====
This article contains instructions for managing users in a single tenant environment. If you do not have an Org switcher between the help icon and the *Search answers and Liveboards* search box, your company is in a single tenant environment.

If your company uses the xref:orgs-overview.adoc[Orgs] feature for multi-tenancy in ThoughtSpot, you can see an Org switcher to the left of the help icon in the top navigation bar. Refer to xref:admin-portal-users-orgs.adoc[].
====

Refer to xref:groups-privileges.adoc[Understand groups and privileges] to learn about the privileges you can assign to a user.

To manage users, navigate to the Admin Console by selecting the *Admin* tab from the top navigation bar.
Select *Users* from the side navigation bar that appears.
