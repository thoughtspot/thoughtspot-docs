You can customize ThoughtSpot Help to be specific to your data, examples, and documentation.

NOTE: If your organization uses xref:orgs-overview.adoc[], you must be an instance administrator to customize the help menu, not an Org administrator. You customize the help menu for the whole instance. You cannot customize it separately for each Org.

When you configure these Help settings, you set system-wide defaults for all your users.

When your ThoughtSpot users select the Help icon, they see a list of links.

// If a user selects the *Help* link, the customizable help menu opens:

As an administrator, you can add your own links to this default list.
This allows you to include documentation specific to your company, such as information about the data available in ThoughtSpot, where to get support internally, or company-specific training.

To customize the Help menu, navigate to the *Admin* page, and select *Help customization* from the left navigation bar.

TIP: If your organization uses xref:orgs-overview.adoc[multi-tenancy with Orgs], make sure you are in the Primary Org, in the *All Orgs* section. You customize the help menu for the whole instance. You cannot customize it separately for each Org.
