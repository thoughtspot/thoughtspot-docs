Advanced conditional formatting [.badge.badge-early-access-relnotes]#Early Access#::
Rather than simply using conditional formatting comparing a column's measures to a single value (for example, `sales > 10000`), you can now use conditional formatting to compare a column's measures to another column or to a parameter. For example, if you search for `sales this year` versus `sales last year`, you can highlight where sales this year were less than last year. You can set multiple conditional formatting rules to a single table.
For more information, see xref:search-conditional-formatting.adoc#advanced-conditional-formatting[Advanced conditional formatting].

[#custom-charts]
Custom charts [.badge.badge-beta-relnotes]#Beta#::
You can now use custom charts created outside of ThoughtSpot, including third-party chart libraries. To enable this feature, contact {support-url}. For more information, see xref:chart-custom.adoc[Custom charts].


// Mary -- SCAL-150356
[#custom-sets]
Custom sets [.badge.badge-early-access-whats-new]#Early Access#::
You can create custom sets, which can be used to classify values in a list that you can then reuse across multiple analyses. ThoughtSpot introduces custom column sets in this release. A column set is a custom group of values from a single column. For example, you can use custom sets to define regions with specific countries included or excluded. Custom sets are community objects which remain when you navigate away from the Search Data page and can be used by any user with view access to the underlying Worksheet. To enable this feature, contact {support-url}. For more information, see xref:column-sets.adoc[Custom sets].

For more information, see xref:liveboard-ai-highlights.adoc[AI Highlights].
[#keywords-of]
Keywords "of", "percentage of" [.badge.badge-beta-relnotes]#Beta#:: To enable business users to answer questions related to mix, contribution, share of, percentage, and total ratios, we added the keywords "of" and "percentage of". These keywords help answer questions such as "What is the share of a certain storeâ€™s sales as a percentage of the regional whole?" To try out this feature, enter a search phrase in the search bar containing the keyword, such as `sales percentage of store region`, and press *Go*. +
For more information, see

[#feedback-review]
Feedback review::
We made the following changes to ThoughtSpot feedback review for AI Answers:

* Feedback for AI Answers is now Org-aware.
* When you make a change to a Worksheet, ThoughtSpot now alerts you if this will affect any related query feedback. If you accept this and make the change, the feedback depending on that Worksheet is deleted.
//* You can now import query feedback when you move information from a development cluster to a production cluster.

[#sharing-dbt]
Sharing dbt connections::
You can now select a dbt connection and click *Share* to share the connection with other users or groups. You can select whether to allow edit access to the dbt user from the *Share connection* dialog box. For more information, see
xref:dbt-integration.adoc#share[Share a dbt connection].

// Naomi -- SCAL-180960
[#dbt-error]
dbt error message handling::
ThoughtSpot displays dbt error messages that clearly describe whether the error originated in dbt or in ThoughtSpot, where the error was encountered, and what steps users should take to resolve the issue. For a list of the error messages ThoughtSpot supports, see xref:dbt-integration.adoc#error[dbt error messages].

// Naomi -- SCAL-126453, SCAL-201305
[#dbt-connections]
dbt connections join enhancement::
When creating a Worksheet from a dbt connection, ThoughtSpot joins the tables based on the relationships defined in the underlying .yml schema file. Now, joins between the tables will be created local to the Worksheet instead of creating a global join between the tables.

// Naomi -- SCAL-164290, SCAL-201306
[#ts-groups]
Ts_Groups system variable::
ThoughtSpot now supports the `ts_groups` system variable in Answer and Worksheet formulas. You can use the `ts_groups` variable for data masking, or deciding whether to display the value of a column to a user based on their group membership.

// Naomi -- SCAL-178532, SCAL-201307
[#enhancements-to]
Enhancements to error messages for Search and Answers::
To improve our error messaging when an error prevents data from loading, we introduced a broader classification that allows you to understand issues more clearly. You can click "Copy error details" to download and send a file to your administrators.

// Doc jira: SCAL-202377
[#answer-data]
Answer data panel enhancements::
Now in the new Answer data panel, you can filter as you hover on a column, _By category_ grouping by default, and display the information panel when you click a column.
