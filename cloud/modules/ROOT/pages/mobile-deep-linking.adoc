[#deep-linking]

You can share a link to objects in ThoughtSpot using instant messaging or email and the recipient can open the link in the mobile app or the web.
If a user has the mobile app, the link will open directly in the mobile app.
If they don't have the mobile app, they are presented with the option to download it or to view it on the web.
