:description: Use the Data workspace, available from the Data tab in the top navigation bar, to manage data sources.



Use the *Data workspace*, available from the *Data* tab in the top navigation bar, to manage data sources.

== Data workspace home page

image::manage-data-page-new.png[Data workspace home page]

The home page of the *Data workspace* lists all the data sources available to you.
There are several types of data sources that you may see in the data list.
They are tables, Worksheets, and views. SQL views fall under the _view_ category.
Most users see only Worksheets and views.
Worksheets are the most powerful and commonly used data sources for searching.

Above the list of data sources, you can see quick links to objects you recently viewed. These links tell you when the object was last modified, and when you last viewed it.

=== Data source types
// if we add the ability to upload CSVs, add user-uploaded data to the list of data sources that people see

[cols="15,~,15",option="header"]
|===
| Name | Definition | Created by

| Table
| Raw table loaded by an Administrator
| Administrators

| Worksheet
| Collection of related tables optimized for searching (like standard concept of a _view_)
| Anyone with *Can manage data* permission

| View
| Table saved as a xref:views.adoc[view] by a user through the *Save as view* option on a data search
| Anyone with *Can manage data* permission

| SQL View
| SQL query result saved as a xref:sql-views.adoc[SQL view] by a user
| Anyone with *Can manage data* permission
|===

Selecting the name of a data source shows you detailed information about it, and allows you to edit it, if you have *Can edit* privileges for that data source.

=== Filter data sources

Use the filters and the search bar at the top of the list of data sources to find the data you are interested in. You can filter in the following ways:

* By *source type:* all, Worksheets only, tables only, or views and SQL views only
* By *tag*
* By *author*

You can also use the search bar to find a specific data source, if you know its name.

[#sort]
=== Sort data sources

You can sort the data sources that display on the home page of the Data workspace in the following ways:

* *Alphabetically by author*: You can sort by author alphabetically, either ascending or descending.
Select *Author*, above the list of recently modified data sources.
To see ascending order, select *Author* again.
* *Alphabetically by name*: You can sort by object name alphabetically, either ascending or descending.
Select *Name*, above the list of recently viewed data sources.
To see ascending order, select *Author* again.
* *By how recently anyone modified the object*: You can sort by how recently anyone modified the object, either ascending or descending.
Select *Last modified*, above the list of recently modified data sources.
To see ascending order, select *Last modified* again.

To see more objects, scroll down to the bottom of the page and select *Next*.
ThoughtSpot displays 20 objects on each page.

These changes do not persist across sessions.
If you sign out and sign back in, the view returns to the default.

=== Bulk actions
You can perform bulk actions on the objects in the data source list. To perform bulk actions, follow these steps:

. Click the empty boxes next to the object names, or, if you would like to perform a bulk action on all 20 objects on the page, select the empty box at the top of the list.

. At the top of the list of data sources, several buttons appear. You can xref:sharing.adoc[share objects], delete them, apply or remove xref:tags.adoc[tags], xref:scriptability.adoc#export-object[export them as TML files], or xref:scriptability.adoc#tml-editor[edit them as TML files].

[#data-connections]
== Data connections

The Data workspace also contains information about your data connections.

Your connections appear under the *Connections* tab, in the side navigation bar of the Data workspace. You can add, edit, remap, delete, or apply or remove tags to connections to external data warehouses from the *Connections* page.

To learn more about connecting to your data in an external data warehouse, refer to xref:connections.adoc[].

=== Add a connection
To *add* a connection, select the icon for the type of connection you would like to add, such as Snowflake or Amazon Redshift. If you do not see your data warehouse, and it is one of ThoughtSpot's xref:connections.adoc[supported data warehouses], select *Others*.

You can also create a new connection by clicking *+ Create new* in the left navigation bar and selecting *Connection*.

=== Edit, remap, or delete a connection

To *edit*, *remap*, or *delete* a connection, select the *More* menu image:icon-more-10px.png[more menu icon] for the connection, and select the action you would like to take.

=== Bulk actions

. Select the empty boxes next to the object names, or, if you would like to perform a bulk action on all the 20 connections on the page, select the empty box at the top of the list.

. At the top of the list of connections, several buttons appear. You can delete the connections or apply or remove xref:tags.adoc[tags].

=== Filter connections

Use the filters and the search bar at the top of the list of connections to find the connection you are interested in. You can filter in the following ways:

* By *tag*
* By *author*

You can also use the search bar to find a specific connection, if you know its name.
