:description: Use the Data workspace to manage data sources.

ifndef::spotter[]
Use the *Data workspace*, available from the *Data* tab in the top navigation bar, to manage data sources.
endif::[]

ifdef::spotter[]
To access the *Data workspace*, do either of the following:

- Click the app switcher menu image:spotter-app-switcher.png[Spotter app switcher] and then click *Data workspace*.
- On the _Spotter_ page, select *Manage data > Manage data sources* on the left side of the screen.

endif::[]

The *Data workspace* page lists all the data sources available to you.
There are several types of data sources that you may see in the data list.
They are
ifndef::spotter[]
tables,
endif::[]
ifdef::spotter[]
Worksheets and tables.
endif::[]
ifndef::spotter[]
Worksheets, and views. SQL views fall under the _view_ category.
endif::[]
ifndef::spotter[]
Most users see only Worksheets and views.
endif::[]
Worksheets are the most powerful and commonly used data sources for searching.

Above the list of data sources, you can see quick links to objects you recently viewed. These links tell you when the object was last modified, and when you last viewed it.

=== Data source types
// if we add the ability to upload CSVs, add user-uploaded data to the list of data sources that people see

[cols="15,~,15",option="header"]
|===
| Name | Definition | Created by

| Table
| Raw table loaded by an Administrator
| Administrators

| Worksheet
| Collection of related tables optimized for searching (like standard concept of a _view_)
| Anyone with *Can manage data* permission
ifndef::spotter[]
| View
| Table saved as a xref:views.adoc[view] by a user through the *Save as view* option on a data search
| Anyone with *Can manage data* permission

| SQL View
| SQL query result saved as a xref:sql-views.adoc[SQL view] by a user
| Anyone with *Can manage data* permission
endif::[]
|===

Selecting the name of a data source shows you detailed information about it, and allows you to edit it, if you have *Can edit* privileges for that data source.

=== Filter data sources

Use the filters and the search bar at the top of the list of data sources to find the data you are interested in. You can filter in the following ways:

* By *source type:* all,
ifdef::spotter[]
Worksheets only, and tables only
endif::[]
ifndef::spotter[]
Worksheets only, tables only, or views and SQL views only
endif::[]
* By *tag*
* By *author*

You can also use the search bar to find a specific data source, if you know its name.
