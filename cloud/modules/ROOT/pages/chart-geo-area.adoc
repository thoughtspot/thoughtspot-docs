Geo area charts highlight the regions of interest, and display boundaries for various regions.

To paint a geo area chart, your search must include a geographical column with appropriate granularity. Note that you can create geo area charts using country, county, state, and other sub-nation region data, but not with latitude, longitude, or zip code data.

See xref:geomap-reference.adoc[Geo map reference].

See also the full introduction to xref:chart-geo.adoc[] and specifics of working with them.

[#charts-with-gradients]
== Change chart gradient

You can now choose multiple colors to define a gradient in charts that support gradients -- geo heatmap, geo area, heatmap, and treemap charts. You can control the low, mid, and high values, and numerical value points to customize the gradient.

To define the gradient in a geo heatmap, geo area, heatmap, or treemap chart, follow these steps:

. Open your chart, click the gear icon, and select the measure tile under *Value*. In a search by sales, item type, and city, the value would be sales.

. Select *Edit* under *Gradient*.

. In the Gradient pop-up, define the colors for the *Low*, *Midpoint*, and *High* values using the color selector dropdowns.

. In the text boxes below the color selectors, you can define the low, midpoint, and high points numerically. You can define the low point, high point and midpoint as a narrow range if you would rather only see gradients for the top values of your measure.

. (Optional) Select *Flip Color* to switch the high and low value colors.

. Select *Save*.

== Limitations
Geo area charts do *_NOT_* support conditional formatting.
