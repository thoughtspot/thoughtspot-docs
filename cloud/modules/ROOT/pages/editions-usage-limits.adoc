This article provides information about the usage limits in each ThoughtSpot edition. For details on the specific features of the Team, Essentials, Pro, and Enterprise editions, see the https://www.thoughtspot.com/pricing[pricing page^] on ThoughtSpot.com. _Edition_ refers to the ThoughtSpot license your company has purchased.

== Definition of rows


A “row” is a single, implicitly structured data item in a table contained within the supported ThoughtSpot Connections source data repository (for example, Snowflake). You must purchase a subscription for the total number of rows across all Connections that are made available to ThoughtSpot for querying. You are permitted to query the number of rows that are authorized in your subscription agreement.


ThoughtSpot sums the unique rows of data per Connection. Data rows from uploaded CSV files are counted as well. The maximum number of data rows that you can analyze in ThoughtSpot varies based on the edition you subscribe to.
