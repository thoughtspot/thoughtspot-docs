On the *Liveboard schedules* page, found in *Data > Utilities > View Liveboard schedules*, you can create and manage scheduled Liveboards.
With scheduled Liveboards, you can prepare for recurrent meetings and closely monitored metrics.

With scheduled Liveboard email updates, you can analyze your data offline and share Liveboards with your colleagues, including people who may not have a ThoughtSpot account.

== Scheduling Liveboards

Administrators and users with *can schedule for others* privilege can schedule and manage Liveboard jobs for other users and groups. Users must have at least view-only access to the Liveboards they share.

CAUTION: ThoughtSpot recommends that you remain conservative when deciding who has the *can schedule for others* privilege in your organization. There are  possible security implications when critical information can be shared outside your company.

== Row-level security

Scheduled Liveboards adhere to row-level security rules.
If the recipients are users in ThoughtSpot, they can only see data based on their own access to that Liveboard.
If the user does not have view-only or greater access to the Liveboard, they do not see any data in the email.
However, if the recipients are not ThoughtSpot users, then they have access to the dataset of the Liveboard based on the sender's permissions.
