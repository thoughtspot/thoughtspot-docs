The *Jobs Management* page, found on the *Data > Usage > Jobs Management* section in the ThoughtSpot web application, allows you to create and manage jobs, namely scheduled Liveboards.
Scheduled Liveboards should help with preparing for recurrent meetings, when reviewing the same Liveboard is necessary.
They should also be useful when you have metrics you want to monitor at a consistent interval, like daily or monthly sales targets.

You can get Liveboards emailed to you on a regular basis and do analysis offline.
This introduces an additional format for you to consume and share Liveboards with others, including those who don't have a ThoughtSpot account.

== Scheduled Liveboard creators

Administrators and users with *can schedule for others* privilege can schedule and manage Liveboard jobs for other users and groups.
These scheduled Liveboard creators must have at least edit-only and view-only rights to the Liveboard they want to share.

WARNING: It is recommended that admins carefully choose who to give *can schedule for others* privilege to, since there is a possible security hole where a user with limited access can get a Liveboard email with all access data.

== Row level security

The scheduled Liveboards respect row-level security rules.
This means if the recipients are users in ThoughtSpot, then they can only see data based on their own access to the Liveboard.
If the user does not have at least view-only access to the Liveboard, then they will not see anything in the email.
However, if the recipients are from outside of the cluster, then they will have access to the dataset of the Liveboard based on the sender's permissions.

== Format and layout of scheduled Liveboards

The Liveboard visualizations are attached to the scheduled email as either CSV or PDF files.
Saved configurations such as Liveboard filters are applied to the attachments.
Refer to the <<format-table,format types table>> to see how the Liveboard data is represented in each file format.

To specify the layout of the Liveboard in the email, select *Configure layout options*. For more details about the layout options, refer to xref:liveboard-download-pdf.adoc[].
