== One measure

This example will walk you through how to create a simple line chart when you have one continuous, aggregated field that’s broken down by some dimension.


1. Add a field to *Columns*. This is generally what you want to see on your x-axis. The example below uses a time series.

2. Add a continuous, aggregated field to *Rows*. It will be plotted along the y-axis of your visualization.

3. If it isn’t already, make sure to set your Mark Type to `Line`.

4. Add a dimension to the *Color* channel. Your chart will split into multiple lines, with each series representing a group within your dimension. You should also now have a legend that maps each color to the corresponding series names.

== Multiple measure


This example will walk you through how to create a simple line chart when you have multiple continuous fields.

1. Add a field to *Columns*. This is generally what you want to see on your x-axis. The example below uses a time series.

2. Add the system-generated Measure Values to *Rows*. After you do this, you’ll see that the *Measure Values* shelf appears.

3. Add continuous, aggregated fields to the *Measure Values* shelf to plot them on your visualization. These fields will be plotted along the y-axis of your visualization. You can think of the Measure Values field as a placeholder or variable that references the list of measures you add to the *Measure Values* shelf.

4. If it isn’t already, make sure to set your Mark Type to `Line`.

5. Lastly, add Measure Names to the *Color* channel. This will ensure that each field in your *Measure Values* shelf is now its own group within a bar. You should also now have a legend that maps each color to the corresponding field names.
