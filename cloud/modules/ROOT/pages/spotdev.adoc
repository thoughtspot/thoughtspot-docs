== Add Slack bot to a channel

After connecting to ThoughtSpot for Slack, add the bot to a channel to begin searching. Once the Slack bot is added to a channel, you see a list of simple commands:

* Use `/spot-help` to get help on how to use Spot.
* Use `/spot-show-model` to see the top worksheets in your ThoughtSpot account.
* Use `/spot-show-columns` to see the columns contained in a Worksheet pinned to the channel.
* Use `/spot-suggested-prompts` to see sample questions you can use to query the pinned worksheet.

Before searching in your channel, choose the worksheet you plan to search on, and click *Pin Worksheet*. You can then search on the worksheet by entering a query in the form "@Spot <search terms>." ThoughtSpot for Slack allows you to search using natural language queries such as "@Spot what were my sales by region."
