ThoughtSpot now supports scheduled alerts for changes in xref:chart-kpi.adoc[Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)] in your data. Use the Monitor function to receive notifications when your KPI satisfies a certain threshold condition, or to schedule notifications for your KPIs on an hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly basis. The Monitor feature is part of the xref:answer-experience-new.adoc[new answer experience]. From the *Monitor* tab, you can view and manage all KPI alerts you create or subscribe to. You can customize other aspects of the alert email, such as the email address ThoughtSpot sends it from, from the *Onboarding* section of the Admin Console. Refer to xref:onboarding-email-settings.adoc[].

NOTE: Starting with the 8.5.0.cl release, ThoughtSpot supports cluster-level admin controls for upper-limit monitoring frequency (option available under *Admin > Search & SpotIQ > SpotIQ Settings*). For example, if your admin defines “Shortest time period to check alerts” as “weekly,” then you will not see “hourly” or “daily” options when you create an alert.

[#threshold-based-alert]
== Create a threshold-based KPI alert

Using threshold alerts, you can receive alerts when your KPI reaches a set value. For example, create a condition to receive an alert when your Sales KPI becomes `greater than 200,000`, or when your KPI for Sales weekly `increases by 2%`.

Note that ThoughtSpot checks your threshold condition against the value displayed in your KPI chart at the time period you define. If your KPI temporarily satisfies the threshold condition, but does not satisfy the condition at the time the threshold condition is next checked, you will not receive an alert notification.

To create a threshold-based notification for changes in your KPI, follow these steps:

. Select the KPI you want to monitor, either by accessing a Liveboard, or by searching within the **Answers** tab. +
Optionally, create a KPI and save it as an Answer, then select **Create alert** from the **more options** menu.
. Hover over the KPI visualization and select the **Monitor** icon. +
+

+
NOTE: When you schedule an alert for a KPI within a Liveboard, you must save any changes to the Liveboard before you can use the Monitor feature.

. The pop-up **Create alert for <KPI name>** window appears.
. ThoughtSpot defaults to *Threshold alert*.
. Under *Condition*, select the mathematical operator for your KPI alert:
* Greater than or equal to
* Greater than
* Less than or equal to
* Less than
* Equal to
* Not equal to
+
[NOTE]
====
If your KPI includes a time-series keyword (such as `weekly`), you may also select the following options for percentage changes in your KPI within the defined time bucket:

    * Increases by (%)
    * Decreases by (%)
    * Changes by (%)
====
. Enter your threshold value. The exact current value of your KPI appears below the *Threshold value* entry.
. The default time interval to check for threshold conditions appears below the *Condition* entry.
. [Optional] Select *change* to manually schedule the frequency at which ThoughtSpot checks your KPI for the threshold condition. For example, you can schedule to check the KPI `Sales weekly` every week, every day, or every hour. Note that ThoughtSpot sends an alert if your KPI reaches the threshold condition at the time that it is checked. If a KPI temporarily reaches your threshold condition but no longer satisfies that condition when threshold check is scheduled, you _will not_ receive an alert.
. [Optional] Enter the name of your alert under *Alert name*.
. Your name automatically appears under **Subscribers**. Enter the names of one or more teammates to subscribe them to your KPI alert schedule.
+
NOTE: You must have _view_ access to the data source underlying the KPI to schedule notifications for teammates who also have _view_ access to the data source. You must have _edit_ access to the data source underlying the KPI to schedule notifications for teammates regardless of whether they have access to the data source.

. [Optional] Select *KPI query* or scroll down to see the details of the query that defines your KPI.
. Select *Create alert*.
. The *Add view access* window appears. If you have added subscribers to your KPI alert that do not have view access to the underlying data source, you can remove them from your KPI alert or give them view access here.
+
NOTE: Row-level security applies to your KPI alert subscriptions. For example, if you create a threshold-based alert for a KPI on `Sales` in all regions, you receive a notification when total sales reaches your defined threshold. Another user subscribed to your alert whose access is limited to the “West” region would receive an alert _only_ when sales in the “West” region reached the threshold defined in your alert.

. Select *Done*.


== Create a scheduled KPI alert

Using scheduled alerts, you can define a time period to receive notifications on your KPI.

To schedule a repeated notification for changes in your KPI, follow these steps:

. Select the KPI you want to monitor, either by accessing a Liveboard, or by searching within the **Answers** tab. +
Optionally, create a KPI and save it as an Answer, then select **Create alert** from the **more options** menu.

. Hover over the KPI visualization and select the **Monitor** icon.
+
image:kpi-monitor.png[KPI visualization with monitor icon in the upper right corner]
+
NOTE: When you schedule an alert for a KPI within a Liveboard, you must save any changes to the Liveboard before you can use the Monitor feature.

. The pop-up **Create alert for <KPI name>** window appears.

. Under *Set up your alert*, select *Scheduled alert*.
. Under **How often**, choose whether to receive an alert notification hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly.
.. If **Hourly**, enter an hour interval to receive an alert notification ** Every _n_ hours**.
.. If **Daily**, select a time of day to receive an alert notification. ThoughtSpot displays the time zone in which your cluster deploys. [Optional] Choose whether to receive an alert notification on weekends.
.. If **Weekly**, choose a minimum of one weekday to receive an alert notification. Select a time of day to receive an alert notification.
.. If **Monthly**, choose a minimum of one date to receive an alert notification. +
Enter the date as a numerical value or a comma-separated list (for example, “5, 10, 15” to receive an alert on the fifth, tenth and fifteenth of each month). Select a time of day to receive an alert notification.
. Your name automatically appears under **Subscribers**. Enter the names of one or more teammates to subscribe them to your KPI alert schedule.
+
NOTE: You must have _view_ access to the data source underlying the KPI to schedule notifications for teammates who also have _view_ access to the data source. You must have _edit_ access to the data source underlying the KPI to schedule notifications for teammates regardless of whether they have access to the data source.

. Select **Save**.

== Edit a KPI alert

ThoughtSpot emails you a notification of your KPI monitor alerts. Use the links in the email to view your KPI, modify the alert, or unsubscribe from updates in your KPI at any time.

Alternatively, you can alter your alerts within ThoughtSpot. To view your alerts, sign in to ThoughtSpot and select the **Monitor** tab. The alerts that you create or subscribe to appear under **All**. You can subscribe or unsubscribe to any alert within this tab. To view only the KPI alerts you created, select **Yours**.

[#permissions]
== Permissions

Depending on your level of access to the data source underlying a KPI, your ability to add other users to your KPI alert schedule varies. When you enter the name of a teammate to add to your scheduled alert, ThoughtSpot notifies you if the users you add do not have **view** access to the data source underlying the KPI. If you have **edit** access to the underlying data source, you can add any user to your scheduled alerts.

NOTE: Adding a user who does not have **view** access to your scheduled KPI alert automatically gives that user **view** access to the KPI’s underlying data source.

If you do not have **edit** access to the KPI’s underlying data source, you can only schedule KPI alerts for users who already have **view** access to the data source.

NOTE: Admins will be able to view, edit, or delete alerts even if they are not the creator or subscriber of those alerts.


== Limitations

When creating an alert for a KPI, the following limitations apply:

- A KPI chart must be saved as an Answer before you can create an alert.
- When creating an alert for a KPI pinned to a Liveboard, you must first save any changes to the Liveboard containing your KPI.
- You cannot create an alert for a pinned KPI if your Liveboard contains filters applied through the Liveboard **more options** menu. First, remove the Liveboard filters, then refresh the page before creating a scheduled alert for your KPI.
- You cannot apply a filter on a pinned KPI and then create an alert for the modified KPI. +
For example, say you want to create an alert for “Sales”, but only for product type “clothing”. If the Liveboard underlying your KPI does not already filter for “product type= clothing”, you cannot use the **Edit** function to add a filter to your KPI and then schedule an alert. Instead, create a KPI with the desired filters, save it as an Answer, and then schedule an alert.
- If you modify a pinned KPI visualization using the Liveboard’s Explore mode, you must reset the KPI using the reset button before you can create an alert notification.
- You cannot create an alert for a pinned KPI visualization if the KPI is in edit mode.
- Row-level security applies to your KPI alert subscriptions. For example, if you create a threshold-based alert for a KPI on Sales in all regions, you receive a notification when total sales reached your defined threshold. Another user subscribed to your alert whose access is limited to the “West” region would receive an alert _only_ when sales in the “West” region reached the threshold defined in your alert.
