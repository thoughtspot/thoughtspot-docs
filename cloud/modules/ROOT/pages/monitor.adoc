ThoughtSpot now supports scheduled alerts for changes in xref:chart-kpi.adoc[Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)] in your data. You can use the Monitor function to schedule notifications for your KPIs on an hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly basis. From the *Monitor* tab, you can view and manage all KPI alerts you create or subscribe to.

== Schedule a KPI alert

To schedule a notification for changes in your KPI, follow these steps:

. Select the KPI you want to monitor, either by accessing a Liveboard, or by searching within the **Answers** tab. +
Optionally, create a KPI and save it as an answer, then select **Monitor** from the **more options** menu.

. Hover over the KPI visualization and select the **Monitor** icon.

+
NOTE: When you schedule an alert for a KPI within a Liveboard, you must save any changes to the Liveboard before you can use the Monitor feature.

. The pop-up **Monitor** window appears. If you previously created alerts for this KPI or subscribed to alerts created by your teammates, those alerts will appear here.  +
Click **+ Create alert** to create a new scheduled alert for your KPI.
If you have no previously created alerts, you proceed directly to the **Create new alert** page.

. The schedule creation window appears. [Optional] Select **Title** to change the name of your KPI alert.
. Under **How often**, choose whether to receive an alert notification hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly.
.. If **Hourly**, enter an hour interval to receive an alert notification ** Every _n_ hours**.
.. If **Daily**, select a time of day to receive an alert notification. ThoughtSpot displays the time zone in which your cluster deploys. [Optional] Choose whether to receive an alert notification on weekends.
.. If **Weekly**, choose a minimum of one weekday to receive an alert notification. Select a time of day to receive an alert notification.
.. If **Monthly**, choose a minimum of one date to receive an alert notification. +
Enter the date as a numerical value or a comma-separated list (for example, “5, 10, 15” to receive an alert on the fifth, tenth and fifteenth of each month). Select a time of day to receive an alert notification.
. Under **Subscribers**, your name automatically appears. Enter the names of one or more teammates to subscribe them to your KPI alert schedule.
+
NOTE: You must have _view_ access to the data source underlying the KPI to schedule notifications for teammates who also have _view_ access to the data source. You must have _edit_ access to the data source underlying the KPI to schedule notifications for teammates regardless of whether they have access to the data source.

. Click **Save**. The monitor rule you created appears in the Monitor window.

== Edit a KPI alert

ThoughtSpot sends you an email notifying you of your KPI monitor schedule. Use the links in the email to view your KPI, modify the alert schedule, or unsubscribe from updates in your KPI at any time.

Alternatively, you can alter your scheduled alerts within ThoughtSpot. To view your scheduled alerts, log in to ThoughtSpot and select the **Monitor** tab. The alert schedules that you create or subscribe to appear under **All**. You can subscribe or unsubscribe to any alert schedule within this tab. To view only the KPI alerts you created, select **Yours**.

== Permissions

Depending on your level of access to the data source underlying a KPI, your ability to add other users to your KPI alert schedule varies. When you enter the name of a teammate to add to your scheduled alert, ThoughtSpot notifies you if the users you add do not have **view** access to the data source underlying the KPI. If you have **edit** access to the underlying data source, you can add any user to your scheduled alerts.

NOTE: Adding a user who does not have **view** access to your scheduled KPI alert automatically gives that user **view** access to the KPI’s underlying data source.

If you do not have **edit** access to the KPI’s underlying data source, you can only schedule KPI alerts for users who already have **view** access to the data source.


== Limitations

When scheduling a notification for a KPI, the following limitations apply:

- A KPI chart must be saved as an answer before you can create a scheduled alert.
- When scheduling a KPI alert for a KPI pinned to a Liveboard, you must save any changes to the Liveboard containing your KPI before scheduling an alert.
- You cannot create an alert schedule for a pinned KPI if your Liveboard contains filters applied through the Liveboard **more options** menu. First, remove the Liveboard filters, then refresh the page before creating a scheduled alert for your KPI.
- You cannot apply a filter on a pinned KPI and then create an alert schedule for the modified KPI. +
For example, say you want to create an alert for “Sales”, but only for product type “clothing”. If the Liveboard underlying your KPI does not already filter for “product type= clothing”, you cannot use the **Edit** function to add a filter to your KPI and then schedule an alert. Instead, create a KPI with the desired filters, save it as an answer, and then schedule an alert.
- If you modify a pinned KPI visualization using the Liveboard’s Explore mode, you must reset the KPI using the reset button before you can schedule an alert notification.
- You cannot create an alert schedule for a pinned KPI visualization if the KPI is in edit mode.
