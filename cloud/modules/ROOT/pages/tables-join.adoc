Create joins between your tables to improve the accuracy of your Search.

With joins, you can make a single search retrieve rich data and dimensional information across multiple tables of your database.

If your database uses any table joins, they appear in ThoughtSpot.

== About joins

== Create a table join

. Click *Data* in the top menu and choose *Tables*.
. Find your table through browsing, Search, or selecting the appropriate Tag(s).
. To select the table for adding joins, click its name in the list.
You will see the *Columns* view of the table.
+
NOTE: Generally, creating a many-to-one join from a fact table to a dimension table simplifies your search.

. Select the *Joins* tab.
The list of existing joins from the table appears.

. Under *Table 1*, choose the table you want to create a join from (origin table).
. Under *Table 2*, choose the destination table or View for the other end of the join.
This is usually a dimension table.
. Choose the matching columns under each table.
These columns must use the same data type.
. [Optional] You can select multiple columns for the same join.
To add another pair of matching columns to the join definition, click *+Add columns*.
. Specify the join type;
see xref:join-add.adoc#join-type[Join types].
. Specify the join cardinality;
see xref:join-add.adoc#join-cardinality[Cardinality].
. Click *Create join*.

You can now see the updated view of the schema.
You can also see the detailed information about all *Joins*.
Note that after creating the join, you may change its name, type, or cardinality by clicking the edit icon.
If you want to change the data source or column being joined, you must delete the join and create a new one.

Proceed to create all necessary table joins, to support your data requirements.

*Congratulations!* Your search can now pull data from all joined tables.
