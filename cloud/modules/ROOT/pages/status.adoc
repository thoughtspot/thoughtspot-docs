Admin users can now navigate to the ThoughtSpot Status page to monitor the health of services on their instance. If you have Orgs enabled, you access it from the Primary Org.

To access the status page, go to *Admin* > *Status Portal*, and select *Click here to visit Status Page*. The status page opens in a new browser tab.

IMPORTANT: The ThoughtSpot Status page is not supported for GCP clusters.

The status page displays the status of different ThoughtSpot services, like Authentication, Data Connections, Infrastructure Services, KPI Monitor, Search Data, Search Service, SpotIQ, Sync, and Spotter. The page also shares scheduled maintenance timelines, outage notifications, and incident reporting and updates.


NOTE: The ThoughtSpot Status page is in beta and off by default. To enable this feature, contact {support-url}.

NOTE: ThoughtSpot has multiple services in the backend supporting each of your features, and there could be instances where services might show as green in the status page in spite of issues on your instance. While the status page is your window to note any issues or announcements related to service disruptions or maintenance activities for administrators on your ThoughtSpot instance, this is not a comprehensive error state reporting or debugging page for your instance, and contacting {support-url} remains the first call to action if you see any issues.
