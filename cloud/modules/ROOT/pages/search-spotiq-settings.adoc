You can update the <<search,search>>, <<spotiq,SpotIQ>>, and <<liveboard-experience,Liveboard experience>> settings from this page.

NOTE: Changing these settings results in a service interruption for all users for approximately 2 minutes.
To minimize disruption, consider making your changes during a scheduled maintenance window.

[#search]
== Search settings

Under *Search settings*, you can configure ThoughtSpot's indexing behavior, and enable or disable summaries.

To learn more about ThoughtSpot's default indexing behavior, refer to xref:data-modeling-index.adoc[Manage suggestion indexing].

To manage search settings, follow these steps:

. Select the *Edit* button in the *Search Settings* section.
. *Index columns*: Click on the toggle to enable or disable ThoughtSpot's indexing of columns in new connections.
If you disable this feature, all columns from new connections are set to `DONT_INDEX`.
Note that this change only applies to columns from _new_ connections.
You must manually set columns that already exist to `INDEX` or `DONT_INDEX`.
. *Index frequency*: Select a frequency for column indexing from the dropdown.
The options are 8, 16, or 24 hours.
. *Table summaries in adhoc search*: Click on the toggle to enable or disable the display of summaries in adhoc search.
This setting only affects the display of summaries for users on the xref:answer-experience-new.adoc[new answer experience], not the classic experience.
+
NOTE: This setting does not affect the display of summaries in saved objects, such as saved answers, pinned tables, or metric tiles in Liveboards.

. Select *Save changes*.
Alternatively, you can *Reset to default*.
By default, ThoughtSpot indexes new columns at a frequency of 24 hours, and enables summaries.

[#spotiq]
== SpotIQ settings

Under *SpotIQ settings*, you can enable or disable xref:spotiq-custom.adoc[SpotIQ analyze].

To enable or disable SpotIQ Analyze or Monitor, follow these steps:

. Select the *Edit* button in the *SpotIQ Settings* section.
. Click on the toggle to enable or disable the feature.
. Select *Save changes*.
Alternatively, you can *Reset to default*.
By default, SpotIQ and Monitor are both enabled.

[#liveboard-experience]
== Liveboard experience settings
Under *Liveboards experience*, you can manage availability of the xref:liveboard-experience-new.adoc[new Liveboard experience] for all users.

You can turn the new Liveboard experience on or off globally, and specify the default Liveboard experience for all users.
For example, you can turn the new Liveboard experience on globally, but keep the classic experience the default, allowing users to opt into the new experience.

To manage the new Liveboard experience, follow these steps:

. Select the *Edit* button in the *Liveboards Experiences* section.

. Enable or disable the new Liveboard experience.

. If you enable the new Liveboard experience, you can specify whether it should be on by default for all users, or if they should have to opt in.
+
To display the new Liveboard experience to all users, enable the *new Liveboard experience* toggle, then enable the *Make new Liveboard experience default* toggle.
+
To display the classic Liveboard experience to all users, but allow them to turn the new experience on for themselves in their profile, enable the *new Liveboard experience* toggle, then disable the *Make new Liveboard experience default* toggle.
