:description: Manage indexing and SpotIQ settings for your organization from the Admin Console.
:jira: SCAL-202496


You can manage certain advanced settings for your organization from the Admin Console.
This includes enabling, disabling, and configuring the following features: SpotIQ, column indexing, summaries, and the footer for downloaded Answers and Liveboards.

NOTE: If your organization uses xref:orgs-overview.adoc[multi-tenancy with Orgs], you must be a cluster administrator to manage these settings, not an Org administrator. You manage these settings for the whole cluster. You cannot set them separately for each Org.

Navigate to the Admin Console by selecting the *Admin* tab from the top navigation bar.
Select *Search & SpotIQ* from the side navigation bar that appears.

If your organization uses xref:orgs-overview.adoc[multi-tenancy with Orgs], ensure that you are in the Primary Org, in the *All orgs* section of the Admin Console. You manage Search and SpotIQ settings for the whole cluster. You cannot set them separately for each Org.

You can update the <<search,search>>, <<spotiq,SpotIQ>>, <<thoughtspot-experience,Answer, SpotIQ, Liveboard>>, and <<visualization-footer,footer>> settings from this page.

NOTE: Changing these settings results in a service interruption for all users for approximately 2 minutes.
To minimize disruption, consider making your changes during a scheduled maintenance window.

[#search]
== Search settings

Under *Search settings*, you can configure ThoughtSpot's indexing behavior, and enable or disable summaries.

To learn more about ThoughtSpot's default indexing behavior, refer to xref:data-modeling-index.adoc[Manage suggestion indexing].

To manage search settings, follow these steps:

. Select the *Edit* button in the *Search Settings* section.
. *Index columns*: Select the toggle to enable or disable ThoughtSpot's indexing of columns in new connections.
If you disable this feature, all columns from new connections are set to `DONT_INDEX`.
Note that this change only applies to columns from _new_ connections.
You must manually set columns that already exist to `INDEX` or `DONT_INDEX`.
. *Index frequency*: Select a frequency for column indexing from the dropdown list.
The options are 8, 16, or 24 hours. To further customize your indexing frequency and the index start time, contact {support-url}.
. *Table summaries in ad hoc search*: Select the toggle to enable or disable the display of summaries in ad hoc search.
+
NOTE: This setting does not affect the display of summaries in saved objects, such as saved Answers, pinned tables, or metric tiles in Liveboards.

. Select *Save*.
Alternatively, you can select *Reset configuration* to reset to the default.
By default, ThoughtSpot indexes new columns at a frequency of 24 hours, and enables summaries.

[#spotiq]
== SpotIQ settings

Under *SpotIQ settings*, you can enable or disable xref:spotiq-custom.adoc[SpotIQ analyze] or xref:monitor.adoc[Monitor], as well as define the upper limit frequency for monitoring KPIs.

To enable or disable SpotIQ Analyze or Monitor, follow these steps:

. Select the *Edit* button in the *SpotIQ Settings* section.
. Select the toggle to enable or disable the feature.
. Select *Save*.
Alternatively, you can select *Reset configuration* to reset to the default.
By default, SpotIQ and Monitor are both enabled.

=== KPI monitoring frequency

Use the *shortest time period to check alerts* option to define the upper-limit frequency for monitoring KPIs. For example, if you define the upper-limit frequency as "weekly", users in your organization will not see "hourly" or "daily" options when they create KPI alerts.

To change the shortest time period to check alerts for your cluster, follow these steps:

. Select the *Edit* button in the *SpotIQ Settings* section.
. Open the *shortest time period to check alerts* dropdown menu and select one of the following time periods:

* hourly
* daily
* weekly
* monthly
. Select *Save changes*.
Alternatively, you can *Reset to default*. The default frequency is "hourly".

[#visualization-footer]
== Visualization footer settings

Specify the footer that appears in all downloaded Answers and Liveboards. Use this functionality to add a confidentiality disclaimer, for example. You can also allow your users to add their own footers to downloaded Liveboards.

Note that this standard footer does not apply to Liveboards downloaded with the https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/?pageid=liveboard-export-api[Liveboard export API^]. Liveboards downloaded with the API use the footer specified by the `footer_text` API parameter.

To edit the standard footer, follow these steps:

. Select the *Edit* button in the *Visualization* section.

. Edit the text box next to *Downloaded file instructions* with the text you would like to appear in the footer, up to 700 characters.
+
The default footer is *Disclaimer: The information downloaded is confidential*.
+
To allow your users to add their own footers to downloaded Liveboards, remove all content from the text box.

. Select *Save*.

=== Footer behavior

This footer replaces the *Footer text* option that appears when you xref:liveboard-download-pdf.adoc[download a Liveboard as a PDF]. You can see a note under the footer text box: *Footer text was set by your admin*. You cannot edit the footer text for a specific Liveboard; you can only edit it for all Liveboards from the *Admin Console*.

The placement and behavior of the footer differs, depending on the format in which you download an object.

Answer PNG or PDF:: Text appears at the bottom of the page.

Answer CSV or XLSX:: Text appears between the *Data extracted information* row and the *Filter* rows.

Liveboard PDF:: Text appears at the bottom of every page in the PDF.
