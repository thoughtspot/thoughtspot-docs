:description: Before you start a new search, make sure you have chosen the right data sources.

When you first use xref:search-data.adoc[Search Data], ThoughtSpot intelligently selects a data source for you to search. ThoughtSpot chooses the most popular data source in the cluster which you have access to. You can choose a different data source.

NOTE: As part of the new Data Fluency features in the 9.2.0.cl release, you can use a new and improved way to choose a data source. If this beta feature is enabled on your ThoughtSpot cluster, see <<search-choose-data-source-data-fluency, Choosing a data source with new data panel experience>> for details.

== Choosing a data source

Select the *Choose sources* button to browse data sources.

You will see a list of data sources that have been shared with you.
The data sources are usually created by your administrator. If you are a ThoughtSpot Free Trial user, you can xref:csv-load-free-trial.adoc[upload a CSV].

NOTE: You cannot select more than 100 data sources at a time. This maximum of 100 data sources improves performance and limits timeouts due to too many sources.

Searches happen in the context of the selected data sources.
ThoughtSpot will also make suggestions from other data sources for you, if what you're typing can't be found in the selected data source.
