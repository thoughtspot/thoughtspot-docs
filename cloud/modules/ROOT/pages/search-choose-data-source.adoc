When you first use xref:search-data.adoc[Search Data], ThoughtSpot intelligently selects a data source for you to search. ThoughtSpot chooses the most popular data source in the cluster which you have access to. You can choose a different data source.

NOTE: You can still use the classic data panel by going into your user profile, in the _Experience_ section, and setting _Answer data panel_ to *Classic experience*.

== Choosing a data source with new data panel experience

With the new Data Fluency feature, you can use the new Answer data panel experience.

You will see a list of data sources that have been shared with you.
The data sources are usually created by your administrator. If you are a ThoughtSpot Free Trial user, you can xref:csv-load-free-trial.adoc[upload a CSV].

NOTE: You cannot select more than 100 data sources at a time. This maximum of 100 data sources improves performance and limits timeouts due to too many sources.

Searches happen in the context of the selected data sources.
ThoughtSpot will also make suggestions from other data sources for you, if what you're typing can't be found in the selected data source.
