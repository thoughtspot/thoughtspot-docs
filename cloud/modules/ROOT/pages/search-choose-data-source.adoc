:description: Before you start a new search, make sure you have chosen the right data sources.

When you first use xref:search-data.adoc[Search Data], ThoughtSpot intelligently selects a data source for you to search on. ThoughtSpot chooses the most popular data source in the cluster that you have access to. If you would like to use a different data source, select the *Choose Sources* button to browse other data sources.

You will see a list of data sources that have been shared with you.
The data sources are usually created by your administrator, though you can also xref:generate-flat-file.adoc[upload your own data].

Searches happen in the context of the selected data sources.
ThoughtSpot will also make suggestions from other data sources for you, if what you're typing can't be found in the selected data source.
