{connection} warehouse types:

- Cloud: to connect to {connection} ADW
- On Premise: to connect to Oracle Exadata or on-premise database

To connect to Oracle:

. Select *Data* in the top navigation bar.

. Open the *Connections* tab in the left navigation bar, and select the *Others* tile. Alternatively, select *+ Create new* in the left navigation bar, select *Connection*, and select the {connection} tile.

. Create a name for your connection, a description (optional), then select the Oracle connection type, and choose *Continue*.

. (Optional) If your wallet file used for Cloud contains the username and password, check *Wallet contains the username and password*.
Refer to the xref:connections-adw-reference.adoc[Oracle connection reference] for more information on each of the specific attributes you must enter for your connection.

. (Optional) To provide additional key-value pairs that you need to set up your connection to Oracle or customize additional JDBC parameters supported by {connection}, do the following:

- Open the *Advanced Config* menu to reveal the *Key* and *Value* fields.
- Enter your key and value information. Refer to {connection}'s JDBC driver reference documentation for information on {connection}'s supported keys and values.
- To add more keys and values, select the plus sign (+), and enter them.
+
NOTE: Any key-value pairs that you enter must be defined in your Oracle data source. Key-value pairs are case-sensitive.

. Select *Continue*.

. Select tables (on the left) and the columns from each table (on the right), and then select *Create connection*.

A message appears indicating the number of tables and columns that will be added to your connection.

. Select *Create*.

After you add the connection, you can search your Oracle database by selecting *Search now*.

Your new connection appears on the *Data* > *Connections* page. Select the name of your connection to view the tables and columns in your connection.

The connection you just created is a link to the external data source. If there are any joins in the selected tables of the external data source, those are imported into ThoughtSpot.

You can now perform a live query on the selected tables and columns of your connection. Because the selected tables and columns in your connection are linked, it may take a while to initially render the search results. This is because ThoughtSpot does not cache linked data. With linked data, ThoughtSpot queries the external database directly, which is slower than querying data that is stored in ThoughtSpotâ€™s database.

== Share a connection

As of the 9.0.0.cl release, users with *can manage data* or *admin* privileges can share connections with other users or groups that have *can manage data* privileges. Once granted access to a connection, users can add, remove, and modify tables in that connection.

To share a connection with another user, follow these steps:

. Navigate to the *Data* tab and select *Connections*.

. Select the checkbox next to the name of the connection you want to share, and click *Share*.

. In the *Share connection* dialog, enter the ID of the user or group you want to share the connection with. You can use the search bar to find the user or group.

. Select *Done*.

Note that to remove share access from a connection, you must navigate to the *Share connection* dialog and select *Remove access* to the left of the user group or name.
