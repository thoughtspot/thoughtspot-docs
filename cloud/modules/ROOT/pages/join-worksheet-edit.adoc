:description: Learn how to change the join type between the tables within a Model.


When you create a Model, you select a xref:model-progressive-joins.adoc[join rule].
The join rule works together with the joins defined within the Model determine how the tables that make up the Model are joined, and how those joins behave when searching on the Model.

Starting with ThoughtSpot version 5.0, you are not limited to just one join rule for the entire Model.
You can define different types of joins for each join between tables in a Model.
Be default, each of these individual table joins uses an inner join.
But you can override this at the individual join level.

You must have either the *Can administer ThoughtSpot* privilege or the *Can manage data* privilege to modify joins within Models.

. Select the *Data* tab in the top menu.
