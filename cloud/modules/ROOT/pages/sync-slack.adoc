Use ThoughtSpot Sync to connect ThoughtSpot to your Slack workspace and deliver insights directly to a Slack channel.

== Sync to Slack from an answer

To create a sync to Slack from an answer, follow these steps:

. Select the desired answer from the *Answers* tab or from the ThoughtSpot homepage. You must have *Can manage sync* permissions and *view* access to an answer to create a sync.

+
NOTE: You cannot create a sync from an unsaved answer. If the *Sync to other apps* option appears grayed-out in the menu, first save the answer before trying again.
. If this is the first sync you have created for Slack, a pop-up authorization window appears. To grant ThoughtSpot access to send data to Slack from your account, select *Allow*.
