== Introducing Models

Models are a new, easier way of creating what previously were called Worksheets. You can create Models from the *Data* tab, just like Worksheets. You can still create and use Worksheets, but ThoughtSpot plans to deprecate and remove Worksheets in a future release. All worksheets can be migrated to Models in a future release.

Models are created in the new Model editor which provides a more visual and intuitive experience for creating data models.

Benefits of the Model editor include:

- Building a data model visually, by dragging and dropping tables and columns
- Creating joins between tables is faster and easier
- Using the tabbed interface allows you to quickly switch between table and column views, as well as formulas, filters, parameters, and settings.

=== Limitations

You can create either Models or Worksheets, however you cannot do the following:

- Switch an individual Worksheet to a Model
- Switch all Worksheets to Models in a cluster
+
NOTE: When the {model} feature is available to all customers by default in a future release, you will have the option to request ThoughtSpot to migrate all the Worksheets on your cluster to {model}s.

=== About Models

Models are logical views of data which allow you to model complex datasets. These data models simplify access to data for end-users and application services by incorporating these key features, and more:

* *Table joins* supplement the primary data with information from various other data sources.
* *Changing data types* ensures that you can handle mismatches gracefully, For example, conversions of date/time type formats, and processing of numeric codes (such as event IDs) correctly.
* *Derived fields* support flexible expressions and formulas.
* *Renamed fields* make charts and tables easily accessible.
* *Selecting fields* allows you to focus only on the  fields that are necessary to the business use case.
* *Hiding fields* lets you change the visibility of data by obscuring and securing sensitive information without affecting the calculations that depend on it.
+
NOTE: If a hidden column is used in an Answer pinned to a Liveboard, then the entire Liveboard becomes read-only to users. This limits Liveboard functionality, which means the ability to adjust filters and download data is restricted.
* *Changing the default aggregation* of fields in a {model} prevents common mistakes when building visuals.


After xref:data-modeling.adoc[modeling your data], create {model}s to make searching easier.
For example, a sales executive might need to search for information about retail sales.
This data might be contained in several tables (sales, customers, products, stores, etc.), with foreign key relationships between them.
An administrator who is familiar with the data model can create a retail sales {model}, that combines all of the related fact and dimension tables into a single, easy-to-use view, and share it with the sales executive.
This provides access to the data without requiring an understanding of how it is structured.

== Creating a {model}

To create a data model:

. Select *Data* on the top navigation bar.
. Select the *+ Create new* button in the side navigation bar.
. Select *Model*.
+

. Choose how you want to model your data, using one of the following options:
.. To create your own model, select *Build your own with cloud data* and click *Next*.
... To create a new connection, refer to xref:connections.adoc[About connections]
... To use an existing connection, select it from the list, and select *Connect*.
.. To build a model from tables originally created from dbt models, select *dbt*  and click *Next*.
... To create a new dbt connection, select *Add dbt connection* and refer to step 5 of xref:dbt-integration.adoc#integrate[Integrating with dbt].
... To use an existing connection, select it from the list, and select *Connect*.
.. To import the TML for a model, select *TML* and click *Next*.
... Upload your tml files. For more information, refer to xref:tml-worksheets.adoc[TML for Worksheets].
+
NOTE: The information at this link also applies to {model}s.

== Editing a {model}

If you created a {model}, or you have edit permissions on it, you can make changes such as adding sources and columns, adding or editing formulas, changing relationships, and changing column names. You can also rename a {model} or change its description.

To edit a {model}:

. Select *Data* on the top navigation bar.
. Select the name of the {model} you want to edit.
. Select the *Edit Worksheet* button in the upper-right of the screen.
+
NOTE: Even though the button currently says _Edit Worksheet_, it allows you to edit a {model} if you selected one in the previous step.
. Make your changes to the {model}.
+
****
*Edit tables*

Using the More menu image:model_table_join_more.png[More menu] in the upper right of a table, you can edit a table in the following ways:

- Add Join
- Rename table
- Duplicate table
- Remove table
- Show Join Recommendation
****
+
****
*Edit columns*

You can edit columns in the following ways:

- Add columns by dragging and dropping them
- Edit fields in columns
- Delete any column by checking it and selecting *Delete*
****
+
****
*Edit formulas, filters, parameters, and settings*

You can edit in the following ways:

- Delete formulas, filters, and settings
- Modify properties
****

. Select *Save changes*.

== Making a copy of a {model}

To make a copy of a {model}:

. Select *Data* on the top navigation bar.
. Select the name of the {model} you want to make a copy of.
. Open the *More* menu image:icon-more-10px.png[more menu icon] and select *Make a copy*.

+
The *make a copy* dialog appears.

. Change the name and description, as needed, and select *Save*.
+
When you navigate back to the Worksheet page, your new {model} name appears in the list.
+
NOTE: Even though the page currently only uses the term _Worksheet_, it does show both Worksheets and Models. Any models will appear in the list of Worksheets.


[#role-playing-dimensions]
== Role-playing dimensions

A role-playing dimension is when a single physical dimension is referenced multiple times in a fact table, with each reference linking to a logically distinct role for the dimension. ThoughtSpot supports role-playing dimensions for {model}s. For example, you may have a fact table joined to a dimension table more than once. This is useful for cases such as when you have a sales fact table and an employee dimension table, where the sales table may record the employee ID who created, updated, and owned a record. In this case, you would want to join these three columns to the employee dimension table on employee ID.

=== Implementing role-playing dimensions with {model}s

To implement role-playing dimensions with Models, do the following in the Model editor:

. Go to the *Tables* tab.
. Select the More menu image:model_table_join_more.png[More menu] in the upper right of  the dimension table that you want to use in a different role.
. Select *Duplicate Table*.
. In the _Duplicate Table Name_ window that opens, assign an alias (since 2 tables cannot have the same name) by entering a new name (or alias) for that table.
. Click *Save*.
. Join this logical copy of the dimension table to the fact table with the join condition corresponding to the new role.
+
. Go to the *Columns* tab.
. Add columns from the new role-playing dimension.
+
It will appear as a new table (with the alias assigned in step 4) on the left panel in the *Columns* tab of the model. You can tell it's a role-playing dimension because the original table name appears in parentheses *()* next to the new name.

CAUTION: Copies/aliases of tables that are on the "many" side of a join are not supported in {model}s.
