:description: Displaying your Liveboard as a slideshow is a good way to present its contents to others.




With ThoughtSpot's interactive presentations, you can easily explore and answer questions from the audience during the presentation session.
When you present your Liveboard, ThoughtSpot displays the component visualizations and tables in order from left to right, and top to bottom.

To start a presentation, follow these steps:

. Select *Liveboards* on the top navigation bar.


. Select a Liveboard from the list of Liveboards by clicking its title.
. In the open Liveboard, select the *more options* menu image:icon-more-10px.png[more options menu icon] (ellipses icon).

. Select *Present*.
. ThoughtSpot displays the Liveboard in full screen. If the Liveboard has multiple tabs, the presentation includes a title slide for each tab before presenting visualizations in the tab.
