You can now migrate coaching from one Model to another across different Orgs and instances using the coaching TML file. This feature allows you to transfer coaching insights efficiently, eliminating the need to duplicate efforts in training Spotter for each Model separately. To export or import coaching, you must have edit access to the respective Models.


== Migration target scenarios


The three main factors to consider in migrating Spotter coaching are:


* Target and source environments.
* Number of targets.
* Target Model differences.


=== Target and source environments


Across different clusters:: A common scenario where analysts test Spotter on a Model in a development environment and, once satisfied with the training, replicate this to the production environment for business users. This applies to both Cloud and Embedded customers.
Within the same cluster or environment:: Users often migrate training from one Worksheet to another within the same cluster.
+
Use Cases:
+
--
* Embedded customers might have a primary Model and want to replicate training across Models dedicated to different end clients separated by user groups within the same environment.
* Customers might be creating a reduced version of a Model to enable Spotter when the existing use case is too difficult to train in one session.
* Customers might have identical Models in a cluster and want to train on all of them in one session.
--


Across different Orgs:: Embedded customers often operate multiple Orgs within an instance and need to migrate training from one Model in a primary Org to Models in other Orgs.


=== Number of targets


From one source Model to a single target Model::
Typically, customers migrate training from a development Model to production to ensure consistency for business users. This process is straightforward, focusing on one-to-one replication.
From one source Model to multiple target Models:: Training across multiple Models in one cluster in one session:
+
--
* Customers aim to avoid duplicating training efforts on similar Models.
* For instance, one company wants to train on multiple identical Models (only differing by data rows). Another company also wanted to train on the table level since most of the Models were derived from one base table.
* In the current scenario, this can only be addressed efficiently through migration, where training is performed on one Model and then migrated to others.


Replicating experience for multiple customers:::
Embedded customers often need to migrate training data to Models for each of their end clients to provide a consistent experience across their client base.
--


=== Target Model differences


Customers want to replicate the Spotter experience from one Model to another. However, depending upon the difference between the two Models, there could be challenges in migration or replicating the experience.


Identical Model::
Target Models are direct copies of the original Model, sharing the same data columns. +
Migration in this case ensures consistency and allows for seamless replication of the training without any adjustments.


Slightly different Model::
Target Models may differ from the source Model:
+
--
* Contain additional or fewer columns.
* Have the same columns with modified names.
--
+
While the underlying table joins might stay consistent, Embedded customers often adjust Models according to their clients' data.
Adaptations are necessary to maintain the relevance and effectiveness of training during migration.




== Export coaching from a Model


You can export coaching TML files from the Model view in the Data workspace by following these steps:


. Navigate to the Data workspace and select the Model containing the coaching you want to export.


. Select the *more options* icon image:icon-more-10px.png[more options icon] and hover over the *TML* section.
+

NOTE: No coaching file is created if there are no coaching entries associated with the Model.


== Export coaching from Coach Spotter


You can export coaching from the Spotter coaching pages in the Data workspace. To export coaching from the Spotter coaching pages, follow these steps:


. Navigate to the Data workspace and select *Reference questions* or *Business terms* from the left menu.


. Select the checkboxes next to the questions or terms for which you want to export a TML file. Below the Spotter heading, the following three options appear:


* Change access
* Delete
* Export


. Select *Export*. The TML file automatically downloads.




== Export coaching using ThoughtSpot Embedded APIs


You can download coaching TMLs from ThoughtSpot Embedded APIs as long as you are using v2. The specific API is `/api/rest/2.0/metadata/tml/export`.


To export only the TML of coaching associated with an object, set the GUID of the object as `identifier` and set the `type` as `FEEDBACK` in the `metadata` array.


To export the TML of an object along with the coaching associated with it, set the GUID of the object as `identifier`, set the `type` as `LOGICAL_TABLE` in the `metadata` array, and set `export_with_associated_feedbacks` in `export_options` to true.


We also support custom object IDs in coaching TML files.


NOTE: xref:tml.adoc#object-id[Object IDs] are in beta and off by default. To enable them, contact {support-url}.


== Import coaching into ThoughtSpot


=== Import into a Model


To import a coaching TML file directly into a Model, follow these steps:


. Navigate to the Data workspace and open the Model you want to import TML coaching into.


. Select the *more options* icon image:icon-more-10px.png[more options icon] and hover over the *TML* section.
+

== Resolving errors


To avoid errors with coaching TML files, check the following before uploading:


* Check that the GUID present at the top of the file is a valid Model already present in the system.
+
NOTE: We do not currently support importing a new Model and its coaching in the same zip file.
* Check the sanity of the TML file, making sure you don’t have missing fields, invalid entries for fields like `type`, `access`, `chart_type`, or `display_mode`, invalid `search_tokens` for the Model, or invalid formula expressions for the Model that coaching entries are being targeted for.


* Check for similar entries within the file: No two coaching entries can have the same 'feedback_phrase'. This can occur when uploading coaching entries on the user level, which can have the same coaching phrase. The system will throw an error when uploading multiple such entries. Users have the option to edit the coaching TML to avoid such scenarios.


* Check for conflicts with existing entries: The coaching entry should not have the same 'feedback_phrase' as a coaching present already on the target Model. It will throw a warning and will override the existing coaching entry if import is still done. Users have the option to edit the coaching TML or modify the existing entries to avoid the conflict.


* Do not modify the values for the following fields: `display_mode`, `chart_type`, and `axis_config`. Changes to these fields are not validated by the system during upload and may lead to unintended behavior.
