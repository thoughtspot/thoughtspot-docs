:description: You can show growth over time by using the growth of keyword in your search.

The `growth of` keyword compares the data from different date periods, and returns a percentage of growth.
Enter `growth of` at the beginning of your query.
You can only use the `growth of` keyword once in your query.

== Growth of measure by year

To search using growth over time:

. Type `growth of` into the search bar, and choose a measure you're interested in seeing the growth of.
+

+
You see a list of suggestions to choose from, based on your data sources.
You  can also type a different column name containing numeric data to compare.

. Type `by`, followed by a date column name.
+
ThoughtSpot calculates growth of a measure as a positive or negative percentage, for each  period relative to the last period in the series.
The difference between the value of a measure at two dates is divided by the value of the earlier date, and then multipled by 100 to get a percentage.
+
A line chart is a good way to display your data, but the waterfall chart is especially effective to show growth.

. You can also do year-over-year analysis, which compares each time period to the corresponding time period in the prior year.
+
This type of growth analysis is more common in retail and other seasonal  businesses.
To do this, type `monthly year-over-year` after your `growth of` phrase  in the search bar.
+

The `year-over-year` keyword compares data between the same time period from different years.
For example, it will allow you to compare sales from June of this year to the sales from  June of last year.
Note that for the first year, values are labeled as "\{Blank}" in the Data View since there are no previous data to compare them to.

. Add an attribute to your search to see the breakdown of how each grouping of the attribute contributed to the overall growth of your measure.
+
Click *Configure Chart* and drag your attribute to *Slice with color*.

== Display periods (daily) over time (year-over-year)

The `growth of` keyword also supports more hierarchical date buckets and period calculations.
The growth query syntax is as follows:

`growth of <measure_column> by <date_column> <bucket> <period-over-period>`

This table shows the possible buckets and the period-over keywords you can combine:

[cols=5*]

| `monthly`
| `weekly`
| `daily`
