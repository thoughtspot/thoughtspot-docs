:description: Use the Visual Embed SDK, REST APIs, and  developer tools to embed search, visualizations, Liveboards, and the full ThoughtSpot experience.



ThoughtSpot Everywhere provides a low-code embedded analytics platform for developers and product owners to build interactive data apps and integrate ThoughtSpot features directly in their apps, products, or services. Using ThoughtSpot Everywhere, you can embed search-driven analytics, infuse insights into your application, and enrich your website, portal, or product with ThoughtSpotâ€™s analytical capabilities.

With ThoughtSpot Everywhere, you can use the Visual Embed SDK to programmatically embed search-driven analytics, Liveboards, visualizations, or the full ThoughtSpot experience in your app. ThoughtSpot also supports REST API services to allow its users to embed objects, query data, perform administrative operations, and automate deployments.

You can use one of the following methods to embed ThoughtSpot in your host application:

Using Visual Embed SDK::
 Visual Embed SDK provides JavaScript libraries for embedding ThoughtSpot features such as the Search, Liveboards, visualizations, and the full application experience in your product or portal.

Using REST APIs::
