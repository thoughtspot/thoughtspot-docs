:description: Learn how to add a SQL Server connection.

To connect to {connection}, follow these steps:

. Select *Data* in the top navigation bar.
. Open the *Connections* tab in the left navigation bar, and select the *Others* tile. Alternatively, select *+ Create new* in the left navigation bar, select *Connection*, and select the {connection} tile.
+
// ![Click "+ Add connection"]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/redshift-addconnection.png "Click "+ add connection"")
+
// ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/new-connection.png "New db connect")
. Create a name for your connection, a description (optional), then select the {connection} connection type, and click *Continue*.

. Enter the connection details for your {connection} data source.
+

+
Refer to the xref:connections-sql-server-reference.adoc[{connection} connection reference] for more information on each of the specific attributes you must enter for your connection.
. (Optional) Configure proxy for your {connection} connection by doing the following:
.. Select the *Advanced Config* menu to reveal the Key and Value fields.
.. For Key, enter *httpProxy*, and for Value, enter *<proxyHost>:<proxyPort>*.
+
Example: *40.142.32.22:5050*
. (Optional) Provide additional key-value pairs that you need to set up your connection to {connection} or customize additional JDBC parameters supported by {connection}, by doing the following:
.. Select the *Advanced Config* menu to reveal the *Key* and *Value* fields.
.. Enter your key and value information.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you are using SSL with SQL Server, we recommend you set the following key value pairs:

* For Key, enter `encrypt` and for Value, enter `true`.
* For Key, enter `trustServerCertificate`, and for Value, enter `true`.
====

.. To add more keys and values, select the plus sign (+), and enter them.

+
NOTE: Any key-value pairs that you enter must be defined in your {connection} data source.
Key-value pairs are case-sensitive.
. Select *Continue*.
. Select tables (on the left) and the columns from each table (on the right), and then select *Create connection*.
+
image::snowflake-selecttables.png[Select tables and columns for your connection]
// ![Select tables and columns for your connection]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/Trino-selecttables.png "Select tables and columns for your connection")
+
A message appears indicating the number of tables and columns that will be added to your connection.

. Select *Confirm*.
+
Once the connection is added, you can search your {connection} database right away by selecting *Search now*.
// +

+
Your new connection appears on the *Data* > *Connections* page.
Select the name of your connection to view the tables and columns in your connection.

The connection you just created is a link to the external data source.
If there are any joins in the selected tables of the external data source, those are imported into ThoughtSpot.

You can now perform a live query on the selected tables and columns of your connection.
Because the selected tables and columns in your connection are linked, it may take a while to initially render the search results.
This is because ThoughtSpot does not cache linked data.
With linked data, ThoughtSpot queries the external database directly, which is slower than querying data that is stored in ThoughtSpot's database.

You can modify a {connection} connection in the following ways:

* xref:connections-sql-server-edit.adoc[Edit a {connection} connection]
* xref:connections-sql-server-remap.adoc[Remap a {connection} connection]
* xref:connections-sql-server-delete-table.adoc[Delete a table from a {connection} connection]
* xref:connections-sql-server-delete-table-dependencies.adoc[Delete a table with dependent objects]

You can also xref:connections-sql-server-delete.adoc[Delete a {connection} connection].

See the xref:connections-sql-server-reference.adoc[Connection reference] for details of connection parameters.

== Share a connection

Users with *can manage data* or *admin* privileges can share connections with other users or groups that have *can manage data* privileges. Once granted access to a connection, users can add, remove, and modify tables in that connection.

To share a connection with another user, follow these steps:

. Navigate to the *Data* tab and select *Connections*.

. Select the checkbox next to the name of the connection you want to share, and click *Share*.

. In the *Share connection* dialog, enter the ID of the user or group you want to share the connection with. You can use the search bar to find the user or group.

. Select *Done*.

Note that to remove share access from a connection, you must navigate to the *Share connection* dialog and select *Remove access* to the left of the user group or name.
