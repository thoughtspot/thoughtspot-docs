[#prerequisites]
== Prerequisites
Before you can deploy the {spotapp}, you must complete the following prerequisites:

include::partial$spotapp-prereqs-general.adoc[]

* Administrator access to {application}
* Access to all {application} data, in your cloud data warehouse. Refer to <<schema,{spotapp} schema>> for more details. You may need to transfer the {application} data to your cloud data warehouse, if it is not there already.
* Run the required SQL commands in your cloud data warehouse. Refer to <<sql,Run SQL commands>>.

[#sql]
=== Run SQL commands
The following SQL commands help standardize data types and column names. Replace the *database name*, *schema name*, *disability column name*, *grade column name*, *LGBTQI+ column name*, *age column name* (Workday only), and *state column name* (Workday only) with your specific information.

NOTE: The following SQL examples are for the Snowflake cloud data warehouse. You may need to modify the code for the SQL requirements of your specific cloud data warehouse.

== After you deploy the {spotapp}
After you deploy the {spotapp}, you must update the formulas in the Worksheet the SpotApp created with your specific information. Your department names may not match the exact names used in the formula for `Functional Groups`, for example, so you must replace the names in the formula with your own department names.

You must update the following formulas in the *Employee Data* Worksheet in ThoughtSpot:

* Employee Count(Full Time Employee)
* Functional Groups
* Level Buckets
* Level Groups
