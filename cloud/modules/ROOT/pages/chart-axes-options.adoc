:description: In ThoughtSpot, you can start changing all axes options by clicking on the axis, directly in the chart.

To change axis, you can select the axis itself.
This opens the detail axis customization menu in the chart.

You can make the following changes to the axis:

* <<aggregate,Aggregate>>
* <<filter,Filter>>
* <<conditional-formatting,Conditional formatting>>
* <<sort,Sort>>
* <<grouping,Grouping>>
* <<position,Position>>
* <<rename,Rename>>
* <<edit,Edit>>
* <<remove,Remove>>

[#aggregate]
== Change the axis aggregate

To change the axis aggregation, click the *Aggregate* option in the axis menu, and select an alternative from the list of options.

Depending on the type of data type and other settings, the aggregation options include _Total_, _Avg_, _Min_, _Max_, _Total Count_, _Unique Count_, _Std Deviation_, and _Variance_.

[#filter]
== Add, change, and remove filters

To manage the filters applied to the axis (in this example, _Total Sales_), follow these steps:

. Select the *Filters* option in the axis menu.
+
image::edit-axis-filter.png[Change axis filter]

. In the window modal, select *+ add a condition*.
+
image::edit-axis-filter-1.png[Add a condition to axis]

. Select the comparison option.
+
Here, the options include _is greater than_, _is greater than or equal to_, _is less than_, _is less than or equal to_, _is between_, _is in_, and _is not in_.
+
In this example, select _is greater than or equal to_.
+

. Set the relevant numerical limits.
+
Here, enter the maximum of `1000000`.
+
image::edit-axis-filter-3.png[Set filter numerical limit]
+
Note that if you select the _is between_ comparison operator, you must set two limits: minimum and maximum.
Similarly, _is in_ and _is not in_ operators require a list of values separated by ";".

. To add another filter condition, select *+ add another*.
+

. To remove a filter condition, select the delete icon (*x*) next to its definition.
+

. Select *Done*.
+

Here, you can see differences between the original chart and the one with the filter applied: Three (3) of the departments had sales less than $1,000,000, and they don't appear on the newer chart.

To remove a filter from the chart, select the *x* icon on the filter tile.

[#conditional-formatting]
== Apply conditional formatting

include::partial$conditional-formatting-chart.adoc[]

[#sort]
== Change the sort

To change the sorting of a measure on an axis, select the *Sort* option in the axis menu, and choose an alternative from the list of options: _Ascending_ or _Descending_.

image::edit-axis-sort.png[Change axis sort]

Here, you can compare the original chart that was not sorted on the _Total Sales_ axis with the chart that uses descending sort.

[#position]
== Change the position of the axis

It is generally easier to interpret a chart if axes that use the same units of measurement or scale appear on the same side of the chart.
In our example, we can best visualize _Item Cost_ and _Item Price_ on the same side of chart.

To change the position of an axis, click the *Position* option in the axis menu, and then select an alternative from the list of options: _Left_ or _Right_.

Here, we move the _Item Price_ axis from the right side of the chart to the left side.

image::edit-axis-position.png[Change axis position]

You can compare the original chart with the one where the _Total Sales_ axis is on the right, while _Item Cost_ and _Item Price_ both appear on the left.

image::edit-axis-position-applied.png[Compare charts with different position assignments]

[#grouping]
== Change the grouping

When two axes use the same unit of measurement and a similar scale, we can group them together.

To change the grouping on an axis, select the *Group* option in the axis menu, and choose an alternative from the list of options, which are the measures on the other axes.

Here, we change the _Item Price_ axis by grouping it with _Item Cost_.

image::edit-axis-group.png[Group two axes]

Compare the original chart with one that groups _Item Price_ and _Item Cost_ as _Item Price & Item Cost_.
The chart looks cleaner, and clearly communicates the distinct information for each of the two measures.

image::edit-axis-group-applied.png[Compare ungrouped chart and chart that groups similar measures]

Notice that the *Customize* menu shows a linkage between the two grouped axes.

image::edit-axis-group-menu.png[Grouped axes]

[#rename]
== Rename the axis

You can always rename an axis for clarity, brevity, format, and so on.

In our example, it makes sense to rename the axis created from grouping as _Item Price & Item Cost_ to something shorter, like _Item Price and Cost_.

To rename an axis, select the *Rename* option in the axis menu, type the new name, and either click out or select *Enter/Return* on your keyboard.

image::edit-axis-rename.png[Rename axis]

[#edit]
== Edit the axis

When you choose to edit the axis, you get the comprehensive view of everything that can be changed on the axis: you can *Configure* the axis name, position (left or right), and the minimum and maximum values, and you can *Format* the category of the column, its units, and the representation of negative values.

image::edit-axis-options.gif[Edit the axis]

To edit this axis (in this example, _Item Price_), follow these steps:

. Select the *Item Price* axis.
. In the dropdown menu, select *Edit*.
. The *Edit Axis* menu appears.
. In the *Edit Axis* menu, make the changes to the axis configuration and number format:
Configure::
Name;;  Change the name of the axis. Also see <<rename,Rename the axis>>.
Position;; Change the position of the axis relative to the chart.
The options are _Right_ and _Left_.
Also see <<position,Change the position of the axis>>.
Min;; Change the minimum value on the axis.
For example, most charts default to 0-based axis representation for numerical values;
this setting overrides it.
Max;; Change the maximum value on the axis.
Similar to _Min_ limit.
Format::
Category;;  This specifies the number formatting for the axis.
Options include _Number_, _Percentage_, and _Currency_.
Unit;; Unit choice specifies the representation of numbers on the axis.
Options include _Auto_ (ThoughtSpot uses abbreviations for really large numbers only), _None_, _Thousand (K)_, _Million (M)_, _Billion (B)_, and _Trillion (T)_. Note that answer columns inherit the units from the underlying column in the Worksheet, and answer formulas inherit the units of the first column used in the formula.
Negative values;; Specify the representation of negative numbers in one of these formats: _-1234_, _1234-_, or _(1234)_.

[#remove]
== Remove the axis

Removing the axis removes the data from the display, but not from the Answer entirely.
Instead, the column that the axis represents appears in the *Not visualized* section of the *Customize* menu.

image::remove-axis.gif[Remove the axis]

To remove an axis (in this example, _Item Price_), follow these steps:

. Select the *Item Price* axis.
. In the dropdown menu, select *x Remove*.
. The *Customize* menu appears.
+
Notice that the *Item Price* _axis_ and the corresponding data no longer appear on the visual.
However, the *Item Price* _column_ appears in the *Not visualized* section of the *Customize* menu.
