Admin-managed schedules give organization admins the ability to control how frequently users can schedule Reports and dataset refreshes.
This helps ensure that Report and dataset refresh scheduling aligns with system performance, cost-efficiency, and data governance goals.

== How it works

=== For Admins

Admins can define a maximum allowed schedule frequency for all users in their organization. This setting prevents users from scheduling Reports more frequently than allowed.

=== How to set schedule frequency

. Go to *Workspace settings → Schedules → Frequency Settings*.


. Set the Schedule Frequency Settings. You can choose to *Allow all cadences*, or set the most frequent refresh cadence as *Hourly*, *Daily*, *Weekly*, or *Monthly*.
+
There is no default restriction unless specified by an admin.

=== For Users
When scheduling a new Report or dataset, users will only be able to select scheduling frequencies that comply with the admin-defined policy.

=== When editing an existing schedule on a Report or dataset


Even after an administrator sets a workspace-level frequency policy, existing schedules will not be impacted, regardless of whether they comply with the new policy.


Any modification to a current schedule will necessitate adherence to the workspace policy regarding schedule intervals.
