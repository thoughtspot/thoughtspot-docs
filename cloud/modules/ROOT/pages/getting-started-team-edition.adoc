== Step 9: Onboard your colleagues

Configure your environment to use a specific data source and choose initial Liveboards.

To invite team members to ThoughtSpot, navigate to the *Admin* tab and click *+Invite teammates*. You can now follow prompts to add your teammates by email, and add an optional personal greeting. When you create a new user, they automatically get a welcome email and access to the data sources and Liveboards.

We recommend that you also prepare a support strategy for data-specific questions.
