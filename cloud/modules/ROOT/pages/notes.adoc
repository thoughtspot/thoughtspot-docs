== Deprecated and removed features in {version}

=== Worksheets

- Worksheets are deprecated and will be removed in the 10.12.0.cl release.
- Beginning in the 10.10.0.cl release, the Worksheet editor will be disabled as part of the ongoing transition to Models. You will only be able to edit Worksheets through TML or by converting them to a Model.
+
ThoughtSpot recommends that you migrate your Worksheets to Models before the 10.12 release. For more information, see xref:worksheet-migration.adoc[Converting Worksheets to Models].

=== Sage and Ask Sage
- Sage and Ask Sage are deprecated in this release and will be removed in the 10.13.0.cl release.
+
Instead of using Sage and Ask Sage, we encourage to you use Spotter. For more information, see xref:spotter.adoc[Spotter].
+
You still have the option to use Sage, but you must contact your ThoughtSpot administrator to enable it.

=== Liveboard note tile embedding

- Embedding content from an external site like youtube.com or loom.com in an iFrame of a Liveboard note tile is deprecated.
+
You can still embed this type of content in a Liveboard note tile, but you must whitelist the external sites. For more information, see xref:liveboard-notes.adoc[Liveboard note tiles].

The latest release of ThoughtSpot Cloud contains several new and enhanced features.

=== For the Business User

// Naomi â€“ jira: SCAL-244702. docs jira: SCAL-258659
Alerts by attribute:: Alerts by attribute are now available to all users and on by default. You can now set KPI alerts to trigger when a selected attribute changes. This can include changes in the value of the attribute, such as an increase in sales by percentage by state, or a scheduled alert to trigger on a weekly basis.
+
For example, if you wanted to create an alert for a KPI tracking sales of different phones by brand, you could choose the intended brands as attributes and set an alert to be notified when sales for those specific brands dropped by 5%.
