[#new]
== New Features and Functionality

The latest release of ThoughtSpot Cloud contains several new and enhanced features.

[#10-8-0-cl-business-user]
=== For the Business User

Help and support features:: In this release we introduce a unified help and support experience in ThoughtSpot.
+
To open help and support, click the question mark icon.
+
Just like the original information center, you can access *Help*, *Getting started*, and *What's new*. Now, you can also access support, and see the version of ThoughtSpot that you are currently using. The original support icon which appeared in the bottom right corner of ThoughtSpot has been removed.
+
In addition to these features, your ThoughtSpot administrator can add custom links, which appear under the *Contact support* menu item.
+
NOTE: We are gradually making this available to customers, so if you don't see it immediately after your instance is upgraded, it should appear within one month.
+
Chat support changes::: With support, you can still send a message, book a call with a product specialist, or search for answers in our documentation, training, and community sites, using the help and support menu to open the support window.
+
NOTE: If you currently have your in-product support feature disabled, the *Contact support* menu option will display *Report a problem* instead.

Spotter feedback in conversation::
You can now give feedback on AI-generated Answers in Spotter without interrupting your searching conversation. When marking an Answer incorrect, you can now edit the underlying search, save, and review the search query tokens making up the Answer. If you mark an Answer correct, you can review and save the underlying search query tokens so Spotter remembers your choices in the future for similar questions.
+
For more information, see xref:spotter-getting-started.adoc#learnability[Coach Spotter within a conversation].

[#spotter-shortcuts]
Spotter shortcuts [.badge.badge-early-access-relnotes]#Early Access#::
ThoughtSpot introduces Spotter shortcuts that allow you to select from existing verified data constructs, including columns, filter values, and search data keywords. These shortcuts allow you to mix natural language and deterministic inputs when using Spotter. To enable this feature, contact {support-url}.

// Mark. jira: SCAL-224576. docs jira: SCAL-240479
[#parameters-in]
Parameters in column names in charts and tables:: You can now add a parameter as a variable to the table header, column names, and axis names of a chart. Any references to the parameter in a Liveboard or Answer automatically update to show the current value of the parameter.
+
For more information, see xref:charts.adoc#parameters[Parameters in axis and column names of charts and tables].

[#blended-axes]
Blended axes in pivot table charts::
In this release, we introduce a new way of adding multiple measures to pivot table charts called blended axes. With blended axes, you can group measures and control them through a system-defined chip called Values in the chart configuration settings. This chip acts like an attribute, with the different measures as its unique values. You can place measures anywhere across rows and columns in your pivot table. You can also place measures in rows of pivot tables instead of columns. This makes it possible to have more combinations and configurations of charts, and compare multiple measures together.
+
For more information, see xref:chart-pivot-table.adoc#blended-axes-pivot[Blended axes in a pivot table].

// Naomi – jira: SCAL-215657. docs jira: SCAL-243597
[#alerts-by]
Alerts by attribute [.badge.badge-early-access-relnotes]#Early Access#::
You can now set KPI alerts to trigger when a selected attribute changes. This can include changes in the value of the attribute, such as an increase in sales by percentage by state, or a scheduled alert to trigger on a weekly basis.
+
For example, if you wanted to create an alert for a KPI tracking sales of different phones by brand, you could choose the intended brands as attributes and set an alert to be notified when sales for those specific brands dropped by 5%. To enable this feature, contact your administrator.
+
For more information, see xref:monitor-alert-attributes.adoc[Alerts by attribute].
