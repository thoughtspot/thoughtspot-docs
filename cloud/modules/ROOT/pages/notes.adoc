//scal-66335
Personalized Liveboard views [.badge.badge-early-access-relnotes]#Early Access#:: Personalized views allow you to save your own set of values for filters and parameters in a Liveboard without editing the original Liveboard. You can change the values of the already present filters and parameters in a Liveboard to create a view, and save it for future use. The new Liveboard is a view of the master Liveboard, so any changes made to the master Liveboard flow  automatically to the filtered Liveboard view but not vice-versa. This includes changes made to pinned visualizations, tabs, filter chips, and re-ordering.

//scal-165262
Embedding in note tiles:: Embedding in note tiles is now available to all users and is on by default. You can now embed interactive content such as videos, pdfs, or Figma files into Liveboards using the note tile format. To try it out, enter a Liveboard, select the edit icon, and select *Add note* from the top bar. You can then click the embed icon and enter the URL or iFrame code for your content. You can interact with the content embedded in a Liveboard like you would with a website. For more information, see xref:liveboard-notes.adoc#embed[Embedding content with iFrames].

//scal-139891
System Variables in Answer and Worksheet formulas:: Previously, ThoughtSpot supported the `ts_username` variable for use in row-level security formulas alone. Now, users can access the following string variables:
+
--
* `ts_orgname`
* `ts_email_domain`
--
+
`ts_orgname`, `ts_username`, and `ts_email_domain` variables are available to use in Answer and Worksheet formulas. These variables are helpful for data masking.

//scal-140692
Request access to data source from filter:: When creating a filter on a Liveboard or Answer, you must have access to the underlying data source. Users can now request access to the underlying Worksheet through the filter modal on a Liveboard or Answer. For more information, see
xref:liveboard-filters.adoc#filter-request[Liveboard filters].

//scal-142071
ThoughtSpot Slack bot integration:: Get notified in Slack when Liveboards are updated. ThoughtSpot's Slack integration lets you preview Liveboard and Answer links directly in Slack.

//scal-161459
New data panel GA:: The new data panel experience is available for all customers in this release, and is enabled by default. In this release, you can now filter data sources by how they are tagged.

Mobile enhancements:: We made the following improvements to ThoughtSpot mobile:

* We simplified the log in process for the ThoughtSpot mobile app. You can now enter your company email to receive an email with a magic link login, rather than entering the server URL.
* ThoughtSpot now supports IAMv2 login.
* You can now change your ThoughtSpot locale through the Mobile app. When your locale is updated, ThoughtSpot translates labels, date formats and number formats to match the default for your country and language.
* You can now use SpotIQ analysis to directly identify the key drivers for recent change in your KPIs in ThoughtSpot Mobile. KPI change analysis allows you to drill down into the causes of change in your KPIs and customize the insights generated by SpotIQ.
To access this feature, go to your KPI chart and select the caret icon to the right of the percent change label. The *Run change analysis* pop-up allows you to customize the columns ThoughtSpot analyzes. Note that ThoughtSpot runs change analysis between the two most recent data points defined by the KPI’s time bucket (for example, `daily` or `weekly`).
* We introduced improved linking to ThoughtSpot mobile. When you click a link you no longer need to choose whether you want to view the link in your default mobile browser or the ThoughtSpot app. The default behavior is to open the link in ThoughtSpot if it is supported.
* You can now receive ThoughtSpot mobile push notifications. Receive push notifications when a Liveboard or Answer is shared with you. Monitor scheduled and threshold alerts with push notifications.

For more information, see xref:liveboard-notes.adoc#embed[Embedding content with an iFrame].

// SCAL-174031
Multi-date bucketing:: Previously, when adding multiple date keywords to a Search, ThoughtSpot accepted the last entered date keyword as the bucket. For example, if you searched for `revenue` `monthly` `yearly`, ThoughtSpot would interpret `monthly` as `month of year`, rather than using the `monthly` bucket. +
Now, when you add multiple date keywords to a Search, ThoughtSpot preserves the date bucketing implied by the first date keyword. If you would like to change the default date bucket, you can use the *more options* menu for the column and select *Time Bucket* for more options. For more information, see xref:chart-table-change.adoc#multi-bucket[Multi-date bucketing].

=== For the Business User

Change analysis: More insights [.badge.badge-beta-relnotes]#Beta#::
When running change analysis, you can now see additional insights. For example, ThoughtSpot will detect values that underwent the highest percentage change between the two data points defined in your analysis, and values whose share of the total changed the most. The additional insights appear below the main analysis in the change analysis pop-up window.

Query performance visibility [.badge.badge-beta-relnotes]#Beta#::
You can now see the state of query execution for any Liveboard visualization while it loads. If a visualization takes longer than three seconds to load, ThoughtSpot displays the current query execution status (executing query, waiting for connection, or processing query) to help users identify the reason for the delay.

Hidden columns in tables::
You can now hide a column from your table without removing it from your current Search. If you hide the column you’re using to sort results, the sorting order is unchanged. To try it out, create an Answer, open the chart configuration menu gear icon, and drag the selected column to *Hidden Columns*.

Commenting on Liveboards [.badge.badge-early-access-relnotes]#Early Access#::
You can now add or reply to comments, tag other users, or subscribe to comment threads directly on a Liveboard. Users can point out insights or reach out for clarification without leaving ThoughtSpot. To try it out, click the comment icon to the right of the edit icon, and select the data point you would like to comment on. This feature must be enabled by your administrator. For more information, see xref:liveboard-comment.adoc[Comment on a Liveboard].

Natural language narratives [.badge.badge-early-access-relnotes]#Early Access#:: Beginning in 9.6.0.cl, ThoughtSpot generates insight narratives in natural language to summarize the data analyzed in SpotIQ. The narratives are generated by LLM, and appear above the charts created by SpotIQ. This feature must be enabled by your administrator. For more information, see xref:spotiq-change.adoc#natural[Natural language narratives].

Alation metadata::
Alation metadata is now available to all users and on by default. Users can now see metadata information on tables and columns imported from Alation. This information appears when you click on the corresponding table or column in *Search data*. Once connected, metadata information is visible to all users. For more information, see xref:catalog-integration.adoc[Catalog integration].

Verified Liveboards::
We made the following enhancements to verified Liveboards:

- When you request verification, you can now see the underlying data sources that will be shared with the verifier.
- The name of the Liveboard now appears in verification request emails.
- When editing an Answer on or pinning an Answer to a verified Liveboard, a warning banner appears indicating it may need to be verified again.

[#9-6-0-cl-slides]
ThoughtSpot for Google Slides add-on::

ThoughtSpot Connected Slides is an add-on that allows you to insert charts and live data visualizations right into your Google Slides™ presentation. Just connect to ThoughtSpot, find a chart or visualization, and add it to your slide presentation. For details, see xref:thoughtspot-slides.adoc[ThoughtSpot Connected Slides].

Amazon Athena connection::
You can now create connections from ThoughtSpot to Amazon Athena. For more information, see xref:connections-amazon-athena.adoc[Amazon Athena].

Improved error messaging for Liveboard visualizations:: Previously, ThoughtSpot displayed generic error messages for connection errors on Liveboards. Now, you can see the error message received from the underlying Cloud data warehouse.

[#9-6-0-cl-it-ops-engineer]
=== For the IT/Ops Engineer

Alation catalog integration::
Alation catalog integration is now available to all users and on by default. You can now import metadata information related to your tables and columns from Alation into ThoughtSpot. From the Data tab, you can set up a connection to Alation to import column descriptions, column verification status, table descriptions, and table verification status. For more information, see xref:catalog-integration.adoc[].

Index Statistics Liveboard::
Admin users can now see indexing statistics for their cluster using the Index Statistics Liveboard. You can filter the results by connection, table, and column, and see the breakdown of indexed search tokens in the visualizations. This Liveboard helps you see how many search tokens you are using, and can help you diagnose indexing issues and errors.
For more information, see
xref:index-statistics-liveboard.adoc[Index Statistics Liveboard].

dbt sync::
In the past, ThoughtSpot generated a new Worksheet every time a user edited an existing dbt data model. Now, ThoughtSpot maintains a persistent connection with dbt and provides realtime updates. Users can update an object, update an object and create a new object, or simply create a new object.
For more information, see xref:dbt-integration.adoc[].

dbt Worksheet join rule::
Previously, when a Worksheet was created from a dbt model, the default worksheet join rule was "apply all joins". Now, "apply joins progressively" is the default. This means that when a Search is done on the Worksheet, joins are applied as each search term is added, rather than applying all joins to every Search.

Improved multi-tab PDF export from Liveboards:: Previously, you couldn’t export a liveboard with more than 40 visualizations, even if they were across multiple tabs. Starting in this release, you can now export a Liveboard with more than 40 visualizations, as long a single tab has no more than 40 visualizations.

Verified Liveboards:: Admin-assigned verifiers can now mark Liveboards as verified. Users can now request these verifiers to review their Liveboards, and verify if the information displayed is trusted content. Verified Liveboards carry a tag that signifies that they have been audited for correctness. For more information, see xref:liveboard-verify.adoc[Verified Liveboards].

Rename filters on a Liveboard:: You can now edit the display name of filters on Liveboards to better represent your data. To try it out, click the *Edit* icon on a Liveboard, click the filter you want to rename, select *Filter options*.


* How many indexing queries are made?
* What queries are failing and why?
* How long are the indexing queries taking?
* Which connections have the most failures so that the admin can easily identify them?
+
Admin users can access the Indexing Queries Liveboard from the admin tab, and use the results to improve indexing queries performance. For more information, see xref:indexing-queries-liveboard.adoc[Indexing Queries Liveboard].

Custom groups [.badge.badge-beta-relnotes]#Beta#:: You can now create custom groups, which can be used to classify values in a list you can then reuse across multiple analyses. Custom groups are community objects which remain when you navigate away from the Search Data page and can be viewed by any user with view access to the underlying Worksheet. For more information, see xref:custom-groups.adoc[Custom groups].

Alation data catalog integration [.badge.badge-beta-relnotes]#Beta#:: You can now import metadata information related to your tables and columns from Alation into ThoughtSpot. From the *Data* tab, you can set up a connection to Alation to import column descriptions, column verification status, table descriptions, and table verification status. This information appears when you click on the corresponding table or column in *Search data*. Once connected, metadata information is visible to all users.

Date picker enhancement in Search:: We added support for rolling, fixed, and custom date filters when creating an Answer or filtering a Liveboard. Previously, when adding a date filter to a Search, ThoughtSpot supported the conditions `ON (=)`, `ON OR AFTER (>=)`, `BEFORE (<)`, and `BETWEEN`. Now, you can additionally filter for `ON OR BEFORE (\<=)`, `NOT BETWEEN`, `ON LAST`, and `ON NEXT`. To try it out, click the filter icon next to the Date column in the left side menu, or click the date filter below the Answer or Liveboard title. For more information, see
xref:date-filter.adoc[Date filters for Answers and Liveboards].

Monitor alerts in ThoughtSpot notifications:: You can now see notifications for threshold and anomaly alerts in the ThoughtSpot notification service, rather than receiving emails.


Single value selection for attribute filters:: When creating a Liveboard, you can now designate attribute filters as single-select, in addition to multi-select. For example, you could choose to make a Country filter single-select, so users would only see data related to one country at a time.


Geomap chart enhancements:: ThoughtSpot now supports the following enhancements for geomap visualizations:

* We now provide geomap data for all countries. For a full list, see link:https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/List_of_territory_based_projects[Openstreetmap supported countries].
* We now support multiple levels of subdivisions within a country, rather than just city and zip code.
// * Zip code data is now visualized as an area within a region, rather than a point on a map. You must select *Auto select* in the Geo config column of the source table or Worksheet to access this feature.
* We now support visualizations comparing subdivisions of multiple countries in a single visualization. For example, if a selected column contains data from cities in the United States and Mexico, all data would be displayed on a single visualization.
+
To enable these features, the *Geo config* property in the underlying Worksheet must be set to *Auto select*. All Worksheets created after 9.4.0.cl GA classify geographical data as *Auto select* by default.
+
For more information, see
xref:chart-geo.adoc#enhancement[Geo chart enhancements].

Responsive Liveboards:: We have improved the responsiveness of Liveboards. For windows between 1024 pixels and 500 pixels, the Liveboard columns respond to re-sizing. For windows smaller than 500 pixels in width, a horizontal scroll bar appears.

Chart display enhancements:: When you create bar and column charts and slice by color, ThoughtSpot automatically enables gridlines to make the chart easier to read. You can choose to disable gridlines under the chart configuration menu.

ServiceNow Incident Management (Snowflake Connector for ServiceNow):: In this release, there is a new ServiceNow Incident Management SpotApp which allows you to use your ServiceNow data stored in Snowflake. If you use the ServiceNow Snowflake connector to move your data from ServiceNow to Snowflake, use this SpotApp to track the number of tickets submitted, and understand the efficiency of how those tickets are resolved.
+
For more information, see
xref:spotapps-servicenow.adoc[ServiceNow Incident Management SpotApps].

=== For the Business User

Natural language search enhancements:: We made the following enhancements to natural language search:

* The following keywords are now supported in natural language search: "vs", "growth of", and "trend".

* Title and descriptions are now automatically created when you save an AI Answer.

* ThoughtSpot now stores feedback in order to correctly answer related questions. For example, if you correct the column used in an Answer about annual recurring revenue for 2023, ThoughtSpot uses the correct column in Answers about annual recurring revenue for 2022 and 2021.

Pivot table enhancements:: We made the following enhancements to pivot table charts:

- When you download an xlsx version of a pivot table, the measure values are displayed as numbers instead of the general format.
- When you download an xlsx version of a pivot table, row and column labels are shown as separate cells rather than as a column-separated list.
- You can no longer add conditional formatting to a pivot table in heatmap mode.
- Naming of subtotals and grand totals are now consistent in the chart and chart configuration dropdown.
- We now support hyperlinks in pivot tables.
- You can now choose to show or hide row and column summaries and subtotals, from the chart configuration menu. When summaries and subtotals are enabled, you can choose to display them at the top or bottom of the pivot table.


Admin controls for new data panel experience::
ThoughtSpot admins now have more control for enabling the new data panel experience for users. As before, an admin can enable the new data panel experience by going to *Admin* > *Early Access features*, and enabling *Data Fluency*. Each user can selectively enable the new data panel experience by going to their user profile, and setting the *Answer data experience* to *New experience*. In this release, admins can now make the new answer data panel experience default for all users of a cluster, by going to *Admin* > *Search & SpotIQ* and setting the *Make new answer data panel experience default* to *Enabled*.

Headline creation and pinning deprecation:: ThoughtSpot is deprecating the pin Headline to Liveboard feature. Beginning in the 9.4.0.cl Cloud release, users will no longer see the pin icon when they select table summaries. To visualize and pin single aggregated measures, attributes in string/date format, or time-series metrics with sparklines, we recommend creating xref:chart-kpi.adoc[KPI charts]. Existing Headlines pinned to Liveboards will not be affected in this release. For more information, see
link:https://community.thoughtspot.com/s/article/How-to-convert-Headlines-to-KPI-charts[How to convert Headlines to KPI charts].


Webhooks for KPI monitor alerts [.badge.badge-beta-relnotes]#Beta#:: You can create webhooks to initiate workflows in third-party applications based on KPI changes, or send KPI alert notifications to custom channels. For example, if you are monitoring a "current inventory" KPI for an inventory management use case, you can build a workflow to trigger an order placement in a third-party app when your current inventory drops below a particular threshold value. Webhooks for Monitor is in beta and off by default. To enable it, contact {support-url}.

Editing in-use parameters:: When using a parameter in a Search, Answer, or Liveboard, you can now change the allowed values type (for example, from *List* to *Range*). You can also add or delete values from a list parameter while it's in use, or increase or decrease the minimum and maximum values in a range parameter. We do not support changing the data type of the parameter (for example, from `INT` to `DATE`). For more information, see xref:parameters-create.adoc[Create parameters].

Mobile enhancements:: We made the following enhancements to ThoughtSpot Mobile:

* We extended the length of mobile sessions on ThoughtSpot Cloud. If a user visits the mobile app at least once every two weeks, they will no longer be logged out.

* We introduced a Watchlist tab on Mobile to make it easier for users to follow important metrics.

* We simplified the log in process for the ThoughtSpot mobile app. You can now enter your company email to receive an email with a magic link login, rather than entering the server URL.


Introduction of roles and more granular access privileges::

ThoughtSpot introduces role-based access control (RBAC) to allow for more granular access privileges. Use roles to apply privileges customized for your organizational needs.
+
ThoughtSpot includes some standard roles to help existing customers transition to RBAC. To enable RBAC, contact {support-url}.
See
xref:rbac.adoc[Understand RBAC and privileges].

ThoughtSpot for Connected Sheets add-on:: ThoughtSpot Connected Sheets is an add-on that allows you to connect to a ThoughtSpot instance, pull data directly into a Google Sheet from trusted data sources connected to that instance (like Snowflake, Google BigQuery, DataBricks, and others), and use the tools in Google Sheets for ad-hoc analysis.
+

xref:spotiq-change.adoc#change-analysis-contextual[Contextual change analysis].

Admin controls for new data panel experience::
ThoughtSpot admins now have more control for enabling the new data panel experience for users. As before, an admin can enable the new data panel experience by going to *Admin* > *Early Access features*, and enabling *Data Fluency*. Each user can selectively enable the new data panel experience by going to their user profile, and setting the *Answer data experience* to *New experience*. In this release, admins can now make the new answer data panel experience default for all users of a cluster, by going to *Admin* > *Search & SpotIQ* and setting the *Make new answer data panel experience default* to *Enabled*.

ThoughtSpot for Connected Sheets plugin:: ThoughtSpot Connected Sheets is an add-on that allows you to connect to a ThoughtSpot instance, pull data directly into a Google Sheet from trusted data sources connected to that instance (like Snowflake, Google BigQuery, DataBricks, and others), and use the tools in Google Sheets for ad-hoc analysis.

Headline creation and pinning deprecation:: ThoughtSpot is deprecating the pin Headline to Liveboard feature. Beginning in the 9.4.0.cl Cloud release, users will no longer see the pin icon when they select table summaries. To visualize and pin single aggregated measures, attributes in string/date format, or time-series metrics with sparklines, we recommend creating xref:chart-kpi.adoc[KPI charts]. Existing Headlines pinned to Liveboards will not be affected in this release. For more information, see
link:https://community.thoughtspot.com/s/article/How-to-convert-Headlines-to-KPI-charts[How to convert Headlines to KPI charts].

Liveboard tabs in Mobile:: We now display Liveboard tabs in the ThoughtSpot Mobile app. To create a Liveboard tab, you must access ThoughtSpot in a browser.

Show onboarding for new users following the share link:: When users are invited to ThoughtSpot via a Share link, they can now click the *Keep exploring* button to be directed to onboarding.

Natural language search improvements::
We made the following changes to the natural language search feature:

* Redesigned search results page. Filtering facets are now in the left panel.
* You can now interact with the Answers created by natural language search, including sorting values and drilling down.
* Title and descriptions are now pre-populated when you save an AI Answer.

AI-generated Worksheet column synonyms [.badge.badge-early-access-relnotes]#Early Access#::

When you create a Worksheet, ThoughtSpot automatically creates synonyms for each column name. This feature is now available for administrators to enable by default, without contacting ThoughtSpot Support. Users can easily start searching on your data, without knowing the exact names for every column. For example, if you have a column named `Product type`, ThoughtSpot might create a synonym such as `Product Category`. When a user searches for revenue by product category, for example, ThoughtSpot returns sales by product type. This feature must be enabled by your administrator.
For more information, see
xref:data-modeling-visibility.adoc#automatic-synonyms[Create synonyms for a column].


Liveboard note tiles::

The Liveboard note tiles feature is now GA. Add notes to your Liveboards, so that viewers of your Liveboards can quickly understand how to use the data and visualizations you gathered. Note tiles can provide an overview of a Liveboard or visualization, company branding through images, definitions of terms used in the Liveboard, and so on. With the GA of the note tiles feature, you don't need a specific privilege to upload images. See xref:liveboard-notes.adoc[Liveboard note tiles].

Change filter order for Answer filters::

Arrange Answer filters in the filter bar so that they are in a logical, coherent order, by dragging and dropping them to different spots in the list. This makes it easier for viewers of the Answer to understand and use the filters on the Answer. For more information, see xref:filters.adoc#order[Change the filter order].

////
Group aggregate enhancement: reaggregation:: To reduce confusion when using aggregate formulas, the level of detail defined in group formulas is now respected at query level. For example, when trying to calculate the contribution of each store’s sales to the entire region, you might use a group_sum formula, where the sales at store level is divided by the sales at regional level. Your search would include the following columns: `Revenue`, `Customer nation`, `Regional Revenue formula`, and `Customer region`, where `Regional Revenue formula =  group_sum(Revenue, Customer Region)`.
+
According to the old reaggregation behavior, if a customer removed `Customer region` from the search bar, the level of detail in the formula would no longer be respected and the formula’s denominator would re-aggregate up to the total. In this case, the formula result would display revenue as a percentage of total revenue, rather than as a percentage of regional revenue.
+
Under the new aggregation behavior, the formula result will continue to display revenue as a percentage of each region, even if you remove `Customer region` from the search bar. Visualizations will also display the correct aggregation even if the grouping column is not added to the X-axis.
+
For more information, see
xref:formulas-aggregation-flexible.adoc#reaggregation-enhancement[Flexible aggregation functions].
////

////
Date picker enhancement in Search:: We added support for rolling, fixed, and custom date filters when creating an Answer. Previously, when adding a date filter to a Search, ThoughtSpot supported the conditions `ON (=)`, `ON OR AFTER (>=)`, `BEFORE (<)`, and `BETWEEN`. Now, you can additionally filter for `ON OR BEFORE (\<=)`, `NOT BETWEEN`, `ON LAST`, and `ON NEXT`. To try it out, click the filter icon next to the Date column in the left side menu, or click the date filter below the Answer title.

AI-generated answers [.badge.badge-early-access-relnotes]#Early Access#:: You can now use natural language to search for answers to your business questions. This feature is now available for administrators to enable, without contacting ThoughtSpot Support. To try it out, navigate to the Home page, select the search bar labeled *Ask any business question you have* and type your question. When you enter your question, you will see the AI generated answer appear, along with a list of related Answers created by users in your team.
+
You can select the Worksheet to search on by clicking the Worksheet title in the left side of the search bar and selecting a new Worksheet from the dropdown. Worksheets with AI answers enabled display a triangular icon to the left of the Worksheet name: image:icon-ai-answer.png[AI answer enabled icon].

AI-suggested searches [.badge.badge-early-access-relnotes]#Early Access#::
The AI-suggested searches feature helps you think of relevant questions to ask of your own data source, by providing examples of searches. This feature is now available for administrators to enable, without contacting ThoughtSpot Support. This feature is designed to help you get started if you are a new user of Search Data, or if you are working with a new Worksheet.
For more information, see xref:search-ai-suggested.adoc[AI-suggested searches]. This feature must be enabled by your administrator.

Liveboard cross filters::

Liveboard cross filters are now GA. Right-click on any data point in your Liveboard and easily filter the entire Liveboard by that value. For example, if you right-click *California* in a geo chart on your Liveboard, and then select *Filter*, all the other visualizations only show data from California. A visualization for *Total sales by city*, for example, would only show sales for cities in California. This feature is also called _brushing and linking_. For more information, see
xref:liveboard-filters-cross.adoc[Liveboard cross filters].

Contextual change analysis [.badge.badge-early-access-relnotes]#Early Access#::
You can now identify the key change drivers for changes in your metrics in a KPI chart. Select the percent change label or select any two data points on the KPI sparkline to view change analysis on your top 5 columns by usage-based ranking (UBR) and identify the reason behind the observed change. You can view the changes in other columns by clicking *Manage attributes* and selecting the desired column(s). This feature must be enabled by your administrator.
+
For more information, see
xref:spotiq-change.adoc#change-analysis-contextual[Contextual change analysis].

Keywords "of", "percentage of" [.badge.badge-beta-relnotes]#Beta#:: To enable business users to answer questions related to mix, contribution, share of, percentage, and total ratios, we added the keywords “of” and “percentage of”. These keywords help answer questions such as “What is the share of a certain store’s sales as a percentage of the regional whole?” Previously, searches such as these required the use of a group aggregate formula, which presented a barrier to users. +
For more information, see
xref:formulas-keywords.adoc[Keywords: Of and Percentage of]. This feature is off by default. To enable it, contact {support-url}.

Attributes in pivot table cells:: You can now include attributes in the pivot table cells as well as measures. This is useful for cases when you want to summarize text data such as user role, pass/fail, or other attributes. For more information, see
xref:chart-pivot-table.adoc#attributes[Pivot table charts].

Ability to change legend position:: You can now configure the legend position of a chart, or hide the legend. The available options are left, right, above, and below the visualization. To try it out, open the chart configuration menu, select *Settings*, and choose between *Legend on right*, *Legend on left*, *Legend on top*, and *Legend on bottom*. You can select the Show legend toggle to hide or show the legend. See
xref:chart-change.adoc#legend[Changing charts].

Liveboard header visible when you scroll down::
When you scroll down in a Liveboard, the Liveboard name, menu options, and filter and tab bars remain visible. You don't need to scroll back up to the top to edit the Liveboard or check if you're filtering by a specific store. You can see the filters or parameters applied to the Liveboard, select the *Edit* button or more options image:icon-more-10px.png[more options menu icon] menu, and view which tab you're on from any spot in the Liveboard.

Optionally change contextual menu to left-click::

In this release, we introduce the option change the contextual menu interaction to left-click. Then, you can access the contextual menu for visualization data points with a left click. Instead of right-clicking on a data point to include or exclude it, drill down on it, or show underlying data, now you can access the menu more easily, with a single left click.
+
This feature is off by default. To enable it, contact {support-url}.

AI-generated Worksheet column synonyms [.badge.badge-private-preview-relnotes]#Private Preview#::

When you create a Worksheet, ThoughtSpot automatically creates synonyms for each column name. Users can easily start searching on your data, without knowing the exact names for every column. For example, if you have a column named `Product type`, ThoughtSpot might create a synonym such as `Product Category`. When a user searches for revenue by product category, for example, ThoughtSpot returns sales by product type. This feature must be enabled by {support-url}.
For more information, see
xref:data-modeling-visibility.adoc#automatic-synonyms[Create synonyms for a column].

Liveboard note tiles [.badge.badge-early-access-relnotes]#Early Access#::

Add notes to your Liveboards, so that viewers of your Liveboards can quickly understand how to use the data and visualizations you gathered. Note tiles can provide an overview of a Liveboard or visualization, company branding through images, definitions of terms used in the Liveboard, and so on. This feature must be enabled by your administrator. See xref:liveboard-notes.adoc[Liveboard note tiles].

Upload custom geo maps::
Upload your own custom maps and visualize data on xref:chart-geo.adoc[geo charts] with regions that are specific to you and your organization.
+
For more information, see xref:geomaps-custom.adoc[].

Parameters::
The Parameters feature is now GA and on by default. Any user can now create Parameters at the Answer level to optimize their data inquiries. Analysts can also create Worksheet Parameters that are available to all Worksheet users. Use Parameters to run different scenarios with adjustable values, without creating or modifying the constants in formulas for each new value. For more information, refer to xref:parameters-create.adoc[] and xref:parameters-use.adoc[].

Change filter order for Liveboard filters::

Arrange Liveboard filters in the filter bar so that they are in a logical, coherent order, by dragging and dropping them to different spots in the list. This makes it easier for viewers of the Liveboard to understand and use the filters on the Liveboard. For more information, see xref:liveboard-filters.adoc#order[Change the filter order].

TML for Monitor alerts::
TML for Monitor alerts is now GA and on by default. Export, edit, and import xref:monitor.adoc[KPI Monitor alerts] programmatically, using ThoughtSpot Modeling Language. For more information, see xref:tml.adoc#syntax-alerts[Syntax of the Monitor alert TML file].

Remove attached files from scheduled emails:: For data security, you may choose to remove attached files from scheduled Liveboard emails. When this feature is enabled, scheduled Liveboard email recipients will receive an email with a link to the Liveboard, which they will need to sign in to see.To ensure that only signed-in users can access your data, contact {support-url} to enable this option. For more information, see xref:schedule-liveboards.adoc#disable-csv-pdf[Scheduled Liveboards].

Add a custom message in the alert notification:: When creating an alert for a KPI chart, you can now include a custom message in the alert update email. You can use this feature to specify next steps the alert subscribers should take once the KPI reaches a certain threshold.

Disable heatmap data labels::

Optionally disable heatmap charts' data labels, and understand the chart quickly by scanning the heatmap colors. This makes complex heatmap charts with many data values easier to read. See xref:chart-heatmap.adoc#labels[Heatmap charts].

Show timezone in scheduled Liveboards modal:: When scheduling Liveboards, you can now specify your timezone.

Search suggestions on columns with many values::
For any column with a high cardinality, which is defined as more than 100,000 unique column values, ThoughtSpot does not index the column if the index type is `DEFAULT`. This means the column values do not show up in search suggestions. Previously, this limit was 1 million unique column values. This change improves performance, and reduces index times and memory usage.
+
If you have existing columns with a cardinality between 100,000 and 1 million, and you use these columns' search suggestions regularly, ThoughtSpot will continue to index these columns.
+
For more information, see xref:data-modeling-index.adoc#high-cardinality[High cardinality and performance].

Parameter runtime overrides::

Adjust Parameter values at runtime from Liveboard or Answer URLs, or using REST API v1 requests. For more information, see xref:parameters-use.adoc#runtime-overrides[Runtime overrides for Parameters] and https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/?pageid=runtime-params[Runtime Parameters^].

Scheduled or downloaded Liveboard PDF width::

By default, scheduled and downloaded Liveboard PDFs now render at a width of 1920 px. This ensures that most Liveboard PDFs you download or schedule look the same as the Liveboards you see in ThoughtSpot. You can also change this default width to a different width for your company, by contacting {support-url}. See xref:liveboard-download-pdf.adoc#pdf-width[Download a Liveboard as a PDF] and xref:liveboard-schedule.adoc#pdf-width[Schedule a Liveboard job].

Specify time zone when scheduling Liveboards::

When scheduling Liveboards, you can now specify your time zone. For more information, see xref:liveboard-schedule.adoc#frequency[Schedule a Liveboard job].


Group aggregate enhancements: filters:: Group aggregate filter enhancements are GA and on by default. Previously, when using group_aggregate formulas, users could use query_filters to include filters entered in the search bar in the formula's value, but it was difficult to write a formula that accepted filters from only a single column. +
Starting with this release, you can specify column names within the ‘filters’ section of a group_aggregate formula, and any filter in your search bar referencing that column will be added to the formula. Filters entered in the search bar that are not on columns specified in the third argument of the group_aggregate formula will be ignored. For details, see xref:formulas-aggregation-flexible.adoc#groupagg-filters-enhancement[Group aggregation filters].

Group aggregate enhancement: reaggregation [.badge.badge-beta-relnotes]#Beta#:: To reduce confusion when using aggregate formulas, the level of detail defined in group formulas is now respected at query level. For more information, see xref:formulas-aggregation-flexible.adoc#reaggregation-enhancement[Flexible aggregation functions]. +
To reduce confusion when using aggregate formulas, the level of detail defined in group formulas is now respected at query level. For example, when trying to calculate the contribution of each store’s sales to the entire region, you might use a group_sum formula, where the sales at store level is divided by the sales at regional level. Your search would include the following columns: `Revenue`, `Customer nation`, `Regional Revenue formula`, and `Customer region`, where `Regional Revenue formula =  group_sum(Revenue, Customer Region)`. +
According to the old reaggregation behavior, if a customer removed `Customer region` from the search bar, the level of detail in the formula would no longer be respected and the formula’s denominator would re-aggregate up to the total. In this case, the formula result would display revenue as a percentage of total revenue, rather than as a percentage of regional revenue. +
Under the new aggregation behavior, the formula result will continue to display revenue as a percentage of each region, even if you remove `Customer region` from the search bar. Visualizations will also display the correct aggregation even if the grouping column is not added to the X-axis. +
For more information, see xref:formulas-aggregation-flexible.adoc#reaggregation-enhancement[Flexible aggregation functions].


Data labels on a dark background::
Data labels on a dark background are now GA and on by default. Labels that appear on a dark background now display in a lighter text color, making them easier to read.

Text keywords enhancements::

We improved the syntax of our text keywords, such as `begins with` and `contains`, to provide users with more flexibility. For example, the `contains` keyword now accepts expressions such as `product name contains 'shoes' or 'snickers'`. See the xref:keywords.adoc#text[Keyword reference].
+
Additionally, if your query includes two or more `contains` phrases that modify the same column, ThoughtSpot now combines the phrases using `or` logic, instead of `and`. If you have existing Answers or visualizations using this `and` logic, ThoughtSpot will automatically update your queries after you upgrade to 9.2.0.cl, to ensure they return the same information. See xref:keywords.adoc#contains[the contains keyword].

AI-generated answers [.badge.badge-private-preview-relnotes]#Private Preview#:: You can now use natural language to search for answers to your business questions. To try it out, navigate to the Home page, select the search bar labeled *Ask any business question you have* and type your question. When you enter your question, you will see the AI generated answer appear, along with a list of related Answers created by users in your team.
+
You can select the Worksheet to search on by clicking the Worksheet title in the left side of the search bar and selecting a new Worksheet from the dropdown. Worksheets with AI answers enabled display a triangular icon to the left of the Worksheet name: image:icon-ai-answer.png[AI answer enabled icon].
+
To try out this feature, you must contact {support-url}.

AI-suggested searches [.badge.badge-private-preview-relnotes]#Private Preview#::
The AI-suggested searches feature helps you think of relevant questions to ask of your own data source, by providing examples of searches. This feature is designed to help you get started if you are a new user of Search Data, or if you are working with a new Worksheet.
For more information, see xref:search-ai-suggested.adoc[AI-suggested searches]. This feature must be enabled by {support-url}.

Liveboard cross filters [.badge.badge-early-access-relnotes]#Early Access#::

Click on any data point in your Liveboard and easily filter the entire Liveboard by that value. For example, if you select *California* in a geo chart on your Liveboard, and then select *Filter*, all the other visualizations only show data from California. A visualization for *Total sales by city*, for example, would only show sales for cities in California. This feature is also called _brushing and linking_. This feature must be enabled by your administrator. For more information about cross filters, see
xref:liveboard-filters-cross.adoc[Liveboard cross filters].

Mandatory Liveboard filters::

Mandatory Liveboard filters are now GA. Mark certain filters in your Liveboard as mandatory. If you add mandatory filters to a Liveboard, the visualizations will only load after Liveboard viewers select values for the mandatory filters. Use mandatory filters for Liveboards that contain data that may not be relevant for everyone who must view and consume the Liveboard. Mandatory filters also lower query and performance costs.
+
For more information, see xref:liveboard-filters-mandatory.adoc[].

Custom comparison points for KPI charts:: You can now set your KPI chart to display a percent change comparison between the most recent data point and a custom comparison point. For example, when searching for `sales monthly`, you can choose to see percent change between this month and the previous month, previous quarter, or previous year. For more information, see
xref:chart-kpi.adoc#kpi-custom-comparison[Custom comparison points].

Change analysis for KPI charts::
KPI change analysis is now GA and on by default. You can now use change analysis to directly identify the key drivers for change in your KPIs.
+
To access this feature, go to your KPI chart and select the caret icon to the right of the percent change label. The *Run change analysis* pop-up allows you to customize the attribute columns ThoughtSpot analyzes. ThoughtSpot runs change analysis for the most recent data point and the past comparison data point as per the KPI chart's configuration. For more information on change analysis, see xref:spotiq-change.adoc[Comparative analysis].
Note that you need SpotIQ privileges to use the KPI change analysis feature.

Anomaly detection for time-series KPI charts [.badge.badge-early-access-relnotes]#Early Access#:: You can now see anomalies in time-series KPI charts. Our new anomaly detection algorithm detects data which does not fall within the expected confidence intervals, while allowing for seasonal changes and growth over time. This feature must be enabled by your administrator. To try it out, open your KPI chart as an Answer, open the chart configuration menu, and select *Show anomalies*. See xref:time-series-anomaly.adoc[].

ThoughtSpot Sync::
You can now use ThoughtSpot Sync to sync data directly from an Answer or custom SQL view to the following apps: +
+
--
* xref:sync-gainsight.adoc[Gainsight]
* xref:sync-zoho.adoc[Zoho]
--
+
Using ThoughtSpot Sync, you can push insights directly to your selected app, notify your teams, and view data in context. ThoughtSpot Sync automatically establishes a secure pipeline to the destination app and thus eliminates the need for building custom connectors.

Schedule ThoughtSpot Sync:: When scheduling a sync with an external app, you can now choose to schedule every 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, and 45 minutes, in addition to the other existing schedule options.


HubSpot Sync mapping fields:: When creating a sync to HubSpot, you can now use email as a mapping field on the Contacts object type, as well as ContactID.

Apply multiple changes to charts at once:: The apply multiple changes feature is now GA and on by default. In previous releases, every time a user reordered the fields in the chart configuration panel, the chart reloaded. When creating a visualization with multiple fields, users often need to make multiple rearrangements to reach a desired chart. Now users can make multiple configurations and apply them at the same time rather than waiting in between each configuration. For more information, see
xref:chart-x-axis.adoc[Reorder labels on the axis or legend].

Specify format when downloading charts and tables::

We streamlined the file format options when downloading tables and charts from ThoughtSpot. You can download tables in XLSX, CSV, or PDF format, and download charts in XLSX, CSV, or PNG format.

Certify Amazon Aurora and Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) for PostgreSQL:: You can now connect to and query Amazon Aurora and Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL databases.

Databricks Catalog field:: When creating a connection to Databricks, you can now enter your catalog name under the *Catalog* field. For more information, see xref:connections-databricks-add.adoc[Add a Databricks connection].

Create a sync as an admin:: When creating a sync to an external app, admin users will no longer see destinations created by other users in the *Destinations* dropdown menu. Admin users will still be able to see a list of all destinations created by users in their organization when they navigate to the *Destinations* tab in the Data Workspace.

Delete table columns using TML::

Remove columns from tables in ThoughtSpot by deleting them in the tables' TML files. We support deleting a column from a TML file and removing that column's dependencies in the same zip file import. Note that if the deletion of a column fails, the whole import will fail. For more information, see xref:scriptability.adoc#delete[Deleting columns, joins, and RLS rules].

Edit join conditions using TML::

Use TML to directly edit a join condition by editing the TML file's `on` parameter. This replaces the existing process of deleting and recreating the join in TML or the ThoughtSpot application. For more information, see xref:tml.adoc#syntax-joins[TML join syntax].

Join creation for views [.badge.badge-beta-relnotes]#Beta#::
We standardized the method of creating joins for all data objects in ThoughtSpot. When creating a join from a view, users are now directed to a *Create join* page where they can choose a connection, name the join, and map the source and destination columns.

For more information, see xref:release-lifecycle.adoc#private-preview[Private Preview features] and xref:privileges-end-user.adoc#preview-sage[Understanding privileges].

Cross-Region Disaster Recovery::

Cross-Region Disaster Recovery allows ThoughtSpot to recover your ThoughtSpot instance in a secondary cloud region in the case of a failure of the primary cloud region where ThoughtSpot is running. This ensures that if one cloud region fails, ThoughtSpot can start in another region, guaranteeing minimal downtime. See xref:business-continuity.adoc#disaster-recovery[Data Protection and Disaster Recovery].

Object Usage Liveboard:: Use the Object Usage Liveboard to easily track how specific objects (Liveboards, Answers, Worksheets, or tables) are trending over time. Our new visualizations allow you to understand adoption on the object-level, and filter on a specific user or users to see usage on the user-level. For more information, see xref:object-usage-liveboard.adoc[Object Usage Liveboard].

Upload your own custom maps and visualize data on xref:chart-geo.adoc[geo charts] with regions that are specific to you and your organization. This feature must be enabled by your administrator.
+
For more information about custom geo maps, see xref:geomaps-custom.adoc[].

Data labels on a dark background [.badge.badge-early-access-relnotes]#Early Access#::
Labels that appear on a dark background can be displayed in a lighter text color, making them easier to read. This feature must be enabled by your administrator.
+
For more information about data labels on a dark background, see xref:chart-data-labels.adoc[Show data labels].

Show measures in pivot table rows::
By default, ThoughtSpot displays measures in columns in pivot tables. With this release, choose whether to display measures in rows or columns in your pivot tables. For more information, see xref:chart-pivot-table.adoc#reorder[Reorder your pivot table].

Apply multiple changes at once [.badge.badge-early-access-relnotes]#Early Access#::
Every time when a user drag and drop the fields in the chart configuration panel, the chart reloads. When a user has multiple fields, they need to rearrange a lot of them to reach a desired chart. Now users can make multiple configurations, and apply them rather than waiting in between each configuration.
+
For more information, see xref:chart-x-axis.adoc[Reorder labels on the axis or legend,window=_blank].

TML for Monitor alerts [.badge.badge-beta-relnotes]#Beta#::
Export, edit, and import xref:monitor.adoc[KPI Monitor alerts] programmatically, using ThoughtSpot Modeling Language. For more information, see xref:tml.adoc#syntax-alerts[Syntax of the Monitor alert TML file].
+
This feature is in Beta and off by default. To enable it, contact {support-url}.

Delete joins and RLS rules through TML::
When you edit and import table TML files, ThoughtSpot now supports deletion of joins at the table level and RLS rules. Refer to xref:tml.adoc[].

Export FQNs when exporting TML files::
To reduce ambiguity when exporting TML files, export the fully qualified names (FQNs) for the objects' data sources. If you select this option, the TML file contains FQNs for the underlying tables and connections.
+
For more information, see xref:tml.adoc#fqn[ThoughtSpot Modeling Language].

Group aggregation enhancement: filters [.badge.badge-beta-relnotes]#Beta#::
Previously, when using group_aggregate formulas, users could use query_filters to include filters entered in the search bar in the formula's value, but it was difficult to write a formula that accepted filters from only a single column. Starting with this release, you can specify column names within the ‘filters’ section of a group_aggregate formula, and any filter in your search bar referencing that column will be added to the formula. Filters entered in the search bar that are not on columns specified in the third argument of the group_aggregate formula will be ignored.
+
For example:
Say that you search for `group formula` `color= ‘blue’` `ship mode != ‘car’`, where `group formula = group_aggregate (sum(Revenue), {ship mode}, {color, quantity})`. In this case, the formula will adopt the color = blue filter but ignore the ship mode filter, evaluating to `group_aggregate(sum(Revenue), {ship mode}, {color = ‘blue’})`. For details, see xref:formulas-aggregation-flexible.adoc#groupagg-filters-enhancement[Group aggregation filters].


[#9-0-0-cl-business-user]
=== For the Business User

Mandatory Liveboard filters [.badge.badge-early-access-relnotes]#Early Access#::
Mark certain filters in your Liveboard as mandatory. If you add mandatory filters to a Liveboard, the visualizations will only load after Liveboard viewers select values for the mandatory filters. Use mandatory filters for Liveboards that contain data that may not be relevant for everyone who must view and consume the Liveboard. Mandatory filters also lower query and performance costs. This feature must be enabled by your administrator.
+
For more information about mandatory filters, see xref:liveboard-filters-mandatory.adoc[].

ThoughtSpot Sync::
You can now sync data directly from an Answer or custom SQL view to the following apps:
+
--
* xref:sync-servicenow.adoc[ServiceNow]
* xref:sync-hubspot.adoc[HubSpot]
--
+
Using ThoughtSpot Sync, you can push insights directly to your selected app, notify your teams, and view data in context. ThoughtSpot Sync automatically establishes a secure pipeline to the destination app and thus eliminates the need for building custom connectors.


Rename Liveboards and visualizations without entering edit mode::
Change the name or description of a Liveboard or visualization without entering *Edit* mode. The more image:icon-more-10px.png[more menu icon] menu for Liveboards and Liveboard visualizations now includes a *Rename* option, where you can edit the object name and description.

Formula function search bar::
The formula editor assistant now contains a search bar for formula functions. Use it to search for specific functions to include in your formula. Refer to xref:formula-add.adoc[].

year_name function::
The new `year_name` formula function returns the year in string format for a given date. This improves the behavior of formulas involving years when using a custom calendar with year values that are not in integer format. Refer to xref:formula-reference.adoc#year_name[Formula function reference].

Headline summaries for discontinuous group aggregate formulas::
We changed the default behavior for table aggregation summaries when the search contains a formulas that contain both a conditional clause (`if... then... else`) and a group_aggregate expression. When a user searches with a formula containing both a conditional clause and a group_aggregate expression, then ThoughtSpot detects the aggregation type on the first non-constant output clause and uses it in the headline summary. In this context, a non-constant output clause means any base column reference (for example, `Revenue`), or formula (for example, `sum(revenue)`).
+
For example, in the formula `group_aggregate(sum(if (Color = 'blue') then 0 else group_unique_count(Discount)))`, the headline summary would use `COUNT_DISTINCT`, since the first non-constant output clause within the `if... then... else` clause is `group_unique_count` and has an aggregation type of `COUNT_DISTINCT`.

[#okta]
Identity and Access Management V2::

Identity and Access Management V2 (IAMv2) is now GA. It is *_off_* by default. With IAMv2, ThoughtSpot switched to a new, industry-standard cloud authentication method through Okta. ThoughtSpot now powers its internal authentication with Okta, which is the industry-leading authentication platform. This change is internal and has no impact on customers. After we enable this feature by default, all user authentication will automatically use the internal Okta service.
+
This switch involves several external improvements to authentication, including security enhancements:
+
--
* Ability to map IDP attributes from the ThoughtSpot Admin Console (username, email, and display name).
* Account activation monitoring from the Users section of the Admin Console: if a user still needs to activate their account, administrators can see that information in the Users section and re-send their activation email.
* Only Okta interacts with your IDP. Your ThoughtSpot cluster does not directly interact with your IDP.
* Local users create their own password during activation. Administrators do not create the password prior to activation.

License agreement::
We made the following changes to the ThoughtSpot license agreement signing process:

--
* First-time admin users see a checkbox to agree to ThoughtSpot's terms and conditions upon login.
* Admin users on updated clusters see a banner to sign ThoughtSpot's terms and conditions within 30 days. You can sign the agreement by clicking *Accept* on the banner, or from *Admin > Legal*.
* If an admin user does not accept the ThoughtSpot terms and conditions within a 30-day period, cluster access is suspended for all users.

Customizable colors for heatmap and treemap charts::
You can now customize the colors used for heatmap and treemap charts. Prior to this release, the only available heatmap color was teal in various shades, and the only available treemap color was green in various shades. Now you can choose any color in your color palette. For more information, see xref:chart-heatmap.adoc[] and xref:chart-treemap.adoc[].

Liveboard tabs::
ThoughtSpot now supports separating Liveboards into multiple tabs. This allows you to group specific visualizations together within a Liveboard. For example, you may have a *Sales* Liveboard that contains top-level KPIs and more detailed charts. You can create a tab for the top-level KPIs for executives to view, and a tab for the more detailed charts that managers need to monitor. For more information, refer to xref:liveboard-tabs.adoc[Liveboard tabs].

Threshold-based alerts::
Threshold-based alerts are now GA and on by default. You can now use the Monitor feature to receive alerts when your KPI satisfies a given threshold condition. For example, create a condition to receive an alert when your Sales KPI becomes `greater than 200,000`, or when your KPI for Sales weekly `increases by 2%`.
For more information, see xref:monitor.adoc#threshold-based-alert[Create a threshold-based alert].

ThoughtSpot Sync:: You can now sync data directly from an Answer or custom SQL view to an external business app like xref:sync-sheets.adoc[Google Sheets], xref:sync-slack.adoc[Slack], or xref:sync-ms-teams.adoc[Microsoft Teams]. Using ThoughtSpot Sync, you can push insights directly to your app, notify your teams, and view data in context. ThoughtSpot Sync automatically establishes a secure pipeline to the destination app and thus eliminates the need for building custom connectors to external apps. For more information, see xref:thoughtspot-sync.adoc[Sync data from ThoughtSpot to external apps].

////
Support for OR in contains operator::
ThoughtSpot now offers the option to `OR` multiple `contains` clauses for the same attribute in a search, instead of combining them with `AND`, which is the default. For example, with the optional new `OR` behavior, `country name contains 'a' country name contains 'b'` returns results such as `Azerbaijan`, `Bahrain`, `North America`, and `Canada`. With the default `AND` behavior, that search returns `Azerbaijan` and `Bahrain`, but *_not_* `North America` or `Canada`.
+

////

Support for multiple contains, begins_with, and ends_with phrases in versus queries::
ThoughtSpot now supports multiple `contains`, `begins_with`, and `ends_with` phrases in `vs` queries. For example, you can now have a versus query such as `state name begins_with 'a' state name begins_with 'c' vs state name begins_with 'd'`.
+
For more information, refer to the xref:keywords.adoc#vs[Keyword reference].

Geo charts enhancements::
This release includes several enhancements to all geo charts:
+
--
* Improved map quality: This includes faster map loading, better clarity, and more granular details down to the street level when you zoom in. This applies to background maps (the parts of the map with no data) as well.
* A new *map type* option that allows you to customize the display of the parts of the geo chart map that do not contain data. The new map type options are Light, Dark, Outdoors, Streets, Satellite, and Satellite Streets. The default is Light.

Denodo OAuth::
Denodo connections now support OAuth. For details, see xref:connections-denodo-oauth[Configure OAuth for a Denodo connection].

Snowflake Oauth improvements::
This release brings improvements in how ThoughtSpot handles user tokens for Snowflake connections configured with Snowflake OAuth. If a user's refresh token becomes invalid, the administrator or author of the connection can now run the Invalidate Tokens command to allow the user to re-authenticate and regain access to the insights provided by the connection, and the connection itself. Also, in this release the _Role_ field has been added to the Snowflake OAuth connection details page, allowing a role to be added when the connection is created and changed when a connection is edited.
+
See xref:connections-snowflake-edit.adoc#invalidate-tokens[Invalidating refresh tokens of a Snowflake connection].

Snowflake CSV upload [.badge.badge-beta-relnotes]#Beta#:: Now you have a quick and easy way to complete one-time data loads of small files that are not present in your cloud data warehouse. You can now upload a CSV file to the database of your Snowflake connection that can be joined to other tables or Worksheets in your connection. Once your administrator enables this feature, go to *Data* > *Utilities*, and click *Upload CSV*.

[#okta]
Identity and Access Management V2 [.badge.badge-beta-relnotes]#Beta#::

In this release, ThoughtSpot switched to a new, industry-standard cloud authentication method through Okta. ThoughtSpot now powers its internal authentication with Okta, which is the industry-leading authentication platform. This change is internal and has no impact on customers. After we enable this feature by default, all user authentication will automatically use the internal Okta service.
+
This switch involves several external improvements to authentication, including security enhancements:
+
--
* Ability to map IDP attributes from the ThoughtSpot Admin Console (username, email, and display name).
* Account activation monitoring from the Users section of the Admin Console: if a user still needs to activate their account, administrators can see that information in the Users section and re-send their activation email.
* Only Okta interacts with your IDP. Your ThoughtSpot cluster does not directly interact with your IDP.
* Local users create their own password during activation. Administrators do not create the password prior to activation.
--
+
For more information, refer to xref:okta-iam.adoc[Identity and Access Management V2].

This feature is in beta and off by default. To enable Okta authentication, contact {support-url}.

When using a group aggregate formula in a Search, you can now view the results grouped at the level of detail specified in your aggregation formula.
+
For example, consider a query where you want to contrast total revenue per region between areas with above average revenue and below average revenue. Previously, queries of this type displayed individual areas with above or below average revenues in each region, but did not aggregate the results.
+
This enhancement also fixed an issue where queries including group aggregate formulas could not be visualized as charts.
+
This feature is in beta and off by default. To enable it, contact {support-url}.

[#liveboard-announcement]
Starting in December 2021, ThoughtSpot refers to Liveboards instead of pinboards.
With Liveboards, you can have an interactive experience and get granular insights through live queries on cloud data, tailored for you.
You can use Liveboards to iterate, explore, and drill into more insights, and tell a continuously evolving data story. +
ThoughtSpot plans to support for several releases, and then retire, internal processes and external methods that use the older naming convention.

[#session-validity]
User session timeout and validity::
ThoughtSpot increased the duration of *idle session timeouts* and the *maximum session validity*, when you click *Remember me* on the login screen.
There is no change to the duration when you do not click *Remember me*.

* Idle session timeout: If a user is not active for 14 days, ThoughtSpot logs the user out, and the user must enter their login credentials again.
* Maximum session validity: ThoughtSpot forces the user's session to expire after 14 days, even if they are active throughout that period.

This change *_only_* affects new clusters created on the November Cloud release and later.
Clusters created on the October Cloud release and earlier have the old experience, even after they update to the November Cloud release.
In the old experience, the *idle session timeout* is 60 minutes with *Remember me*, and 30 minutes without it.
The old *maximum session validity* is 7 days with *Remember me*, and not available without it.

To increase idle session timeouts or maximum session validity for clusters created on the October Cloud release and earlier, contact {support-url}.

This release introduces new administrator privileges that separate the abilities of the administrator into 4 specific privileges.
For example, you can allow certain users to create and manage users, while not allowing them to manage SAML integration or other advanced settings.
These new administrator privileges do *_not_* provide access to all data in ThoughtSpot, unlike the *Can administer ThoughtSpot* privilege.
Users with the new privileges can only see data that others share with them.

[#june-cloud-developer]
=== For the Developer
[#global-local-actions]
Global and local custom actions::
The ThoughtSpot developer portal now supports designating a custom action as a _global_ or _local_ action.
This feature allows you to determine and control the placement of custom actions in the ThoughtSpot UI.
Developers can now choose to create a custom action that will appear on all visualizations or a specific custom action that can be added to a particular visualization by a ThoughtSpot user.
A custom actions panel in the visualization pages allows ThoughtSpot users to view the available custom actions and add an action to any visualization.
For example, if you want an action that triggers a callback into your parent app, which would then post its data to Slack, you might want to add a custom action globally to all visualizations.
Similarly, if you want to send the data obtained from a specific visualization to a URL, you can associate a custom action locally to that visualization.  For more information, see https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/?pageid=customize-actions[ThoughtSpot Developer Documentation].
[#custom-action-auth]
Authentication schemes for custom actions::
You can now apply an authentication scheme for custom actions that trigger a data payload to a specific URL target.
If a custom action requires your users to authenticate to send data to a URL, you can specify the authentication method and authorization attributes when creating a custom action in the Developer portal.  ThoughtSpot will use this authentication information to send the required attributes in the `Authorization` headers to the URL endpoint configured in the custom action.  For more information, see https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/?pageid=custom-action-url[ThoughtSpot Developer Documentation].
[#custom-action-position]
Custom action position settings::
ThoughtSpot users with edit privileges can now define or modify the position of a custom action on visualization pages.
When a developer creates a custom action in the Developer portal, ThoughtSpot adds a menu item to the *More* menu image:icon-more-10px.png[more options menu icon] by default.
ThoughtSpot users can change this to a context menu action or a primary action at any time.
If your application instance requires an action that sends only a single row of data from charts or tables, developers can configure a custom action and restrict it to only the contextual menu.
If this setting is enabled on a custom action, ThoughtSpot users cannot modify this action on a visualization page.  For more information, see https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/?pageid=custom-action-viz[ThoughtSpot Developer Documentation].
[#custom-link-format]
Custom link format for ThoughtSpot embedded instances::
ThoughtSpot generates links to access objects, such as Liveboards, visualizations, and search Answers, when a user shares an object with another user or follows a Liveboard to receive periodic notifications.
If you have embedded ThoughtSpot in your application, you might want to generate these links in the format that preserves your host application context.
For embedded instances, ThoughtSpot now allows you to customize the format of these links in the Developer portal.
The *Link Settings* page in the Developer portal allows you to customize the link format for various resource URLs and the *unsubscribe* link sent in email notifications.  For more information, see https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/?pageid=customize-links[ThoughtSpot Developer Documentation].
[#rest-apis]
New REST APIs::  The ThoughtSpot 7 Cloud June release introduces the following REST APIs: +
