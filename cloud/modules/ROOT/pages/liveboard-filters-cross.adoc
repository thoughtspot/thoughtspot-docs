Cross filters enable you to right-click any data point in your Liveboard and easily filter the entire Liveboard by that value.

You can filter the data on your Liveboard by right-clicking a data point on any visualization in the Liveboard. This type of filter, called a cross filter, or _brushing and linking_, is useful when you are examining your Liveboard and want to quickly see the data related to a specific data point, without creating a permanent Liveboard filter in the filters bar. Cross filters are meant for quick, ad-hoc filtering, so you can't save them. They are different from the permanent filters described in the xref:liveboard-filters.adoc[] article.

== Use cross filters
To quickly filter the Liveboard by a certain value, right-click the value in a visualization on your Liveboard, and then select *Filter*. For example, if you right-click *California* in a geo chart on your Liveboard, and then select *Filter*, all the other visualizations only show data from *California*. A visualization for *Total sales by city*, for example, would only show sales for cities in California.

You can remove a cross filter by right-clicking the data point again, and selecting *Remove filter*, or by selecting the *x* icon that appears when you hover over the filter in the filter bar under the Liveboard name and description.

To remove all cross filters, select *Clear all* in the filter bar under the Liveboard name and description. This removes all cross filters, but does not remove the permanent Liveboard filters.
