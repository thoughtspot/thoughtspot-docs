:description: Learn about aggregate filters.

When working with query filters, you can switch to finer-grained or coarser-grained representation of your data.
ThoughtSpot then re-aggregates the query to generate your new results and visualizations.
Similarly, ThoughtSpot re-aggregates the query when you include or exclude the filter condition in the interface.

== Include or exclude filter condition

With `+query_filters()+{filter_condition}+` or `+query_filters()-{filter_condition}+`, you can aggregate the results when including or excluding a filter condition.

=== Example

Filter condition: `Ship Mode='car'`

When you search on category `Customer ID sales` by `customer id` and category `Ship Mode='carâ€™`, you can add a formula that calculate sales by category for each customer:

----
sales by Customer ID and Category = group_aggregate (
   sum(Sales),
   {Category, Customer ID },
   query_filters()+{Ship Mode='air'}
   )
----

ThoughtSpot aggregates the results  in the following manner:

* Dimensions: '`Category`' and '`Customer ID`'
* Filters: '`air`' and '`car`'.

=== Add a column to query filter

Add a `+query_filters()-{column}+` clause to an expression to aggregate the results _while removing_ the expression related to the column.

=== Example

Filter condition: `Ship Mode='car'`

When you search on category `Customer ID sales` by `customer id` and category `Ship Mode='car'`, you can add a formula that calculate sales for each customer, _while ignoring_ the filter on the column:

----
sales by Customer ID and Category = group_aggregate (
   sum(Sales),
   {Customer ID, Category},
   query_filters()-{Ship Mode}
   )
----

In this case, ThoughtSpot aggregates the results in  the following manner:

* Dimensions: Customer ID
* Filters: none, because ignored
