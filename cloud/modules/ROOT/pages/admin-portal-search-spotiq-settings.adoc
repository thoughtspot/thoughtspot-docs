[#search]
== Search settings

Under *Search settings*, you can configure ThoughtSpot’s indexing behavior, and enable or disable summaries and headlines.

To learn more about ThoughtSpot's default indexing behavior, refer to xref:data-modeling-index.adoc[].

To manage search settings, follow these steps:

. Select the *Edit* button in the *Search Settings* section.

. *Index columns*: Click on the toggle to enable or disable ThoughtSpot’s indexing of columns in new connections. If you disable this feature, all columns from new connections are set to `DONT_INDEX`. Note that this change only applies to columns from _new_ connections. You must manually set columns that already exist to `INDEX` or `DONT_INDEX`.

. *Index frequency*: Select a frequency for column indexing from the dropdown. The options are 8, 16, or 24 hours.

. *Summaries and headlines*: Click on the toggle to enable or disable the display of summaries in adhoc search. This setting only affects the display of summaries for users on the xref:answer-experience-new.adoc[new answer experience], not the classic experience.
