Using ThoughtSpot's relational search is intuitive. In the search bar, type what you are interested in exploring, and ThoughtSpot returns a set of results in the form of a table or a chart. We call this set of results in response to a search an Answer.

ThoughtSpot has two primary search mechanisms:

. xref:search-answers.adoc[Search Answers and Liveboards]
. xref:search-data.adoc[Search Data]
