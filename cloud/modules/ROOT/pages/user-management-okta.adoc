= Create, edit, or delete a user using IAMv2

:description: For each person who accesses ThoughtSpot, you must create an account. When you create a user manually in ThoughtSpot, you manage that user in ThoughtSpot.

[NOTE]
====
This article contains instructions for managing users if your company uses Identity and Access Management V2 (IAMv2). IAMv2 is *_off_* by default. If the *Users* section of the Admin Console contains an *Account Activation* column, your company is using IAMv2. If you are using xref:orgs-overview.adoc[], we do not currently support using IAMv2.

If the *Users* section of the Admin Console does *_not_* contain an *Account Activation* column, your company is *_not_* using IAMv2. Refer to xref:user-management.adoc[].
====

You can create users directly in ThoughtSpot, or import users and user groups through SAML or similar protocols.

For users who have access through SAML, the SAML installation manages all user information.

[#add-user]
== Create a user in ThoughtSpot

This procedure demonstrates how to create a user manually.
When you create a user, you can specify the _<<username,username>>_, _<<display-name,display name>>_, _<<sharing-visibility,sharing visibility>>_, and _<<email,email>>_, and assign _<<groups,group>>_ memberships.
The user inherits privileges and permissions directly from the group assignments.

Note that all users automatically belong to the group *All*.

To create a new user and assign that user to groups, follow these steps:

. Navigate to the Admin Console by selecting the *Admin* tab from the top navigation bar.
. Select *Users* from the side navigation bar that appears.
+

. Select the *+ Add User* button on the upper-left side of the list of users.
. In the *Add a new user* interface, enter the details for the new user. Note that the user creates their password as part of the activation process.
+

+
[#username]
Username::
A login name for the user. Usernames must be unique and lowercase. If you are using Active Directory to authenticate users, and your LDAP configuration requires users to be created manually (they are not created automatically in ThoughtSpot upon authentication), the username you specify has to be domain-qualified (`username@ldap.thoughtspot.com`), and you must enter a dummy password.
[#display-name]
Display name::
A unique name for the user (usually their first and last name).
[#sharing-visibility]
Sharing visibility::
Indicate whether objects can be shared with this user. When set to *SHAREABLE*, this user is an option in the *Share* dialog.
[#email]
Email::
The user's email address. ThoughtSpot uses this for  notification when another user shares something with them, for onboarding, and others.
+
NOTE: During cluster configuration, the administrator specifies the email server domain. ThoughtSpot does not accept emails outside this domain. Contact {support-url} to add new domains to a list of allowed domains.
[#groups]
Groups::
(Recommended) Select the groups for the user.
+
[NOTE]
====
When you create a new user, the groups they belong to define the following attributes for the user:

Privileges:: the actions they can perform, defined when you xref:group-management.adoc[add a group and set security privileges]

Permissions:: the data they can access and view, defined when you consider xref:data-security.adoc[data security]

Administrators can see all data sources, and xref:security-rls.adoc[row-level security] does not apply to them.
====
+
WARNING: If you add the user to a group that has the privilege *Has administration privileges*, they can see all the data in ThoughtSpot.

. Select *ADD* to create the user.

Note that this process of identifying the user's needs contributes to a robust onboarding process.
See xref:onboarding.adoc[Onboarding users].

[#edit-user]
== Edit an existing user

As an administrator, you can edit a user account, and change the user's groups.
You can also help users by evaluating their onboarding experience to ensure they receive the best possible introduction to relevant information in ThoughtSpot.

To edit an existing user, follow these steps:

. Navigate to the Admin Console by selecting the *Admin* tab from the top navigation bar.
. Select *Users* from the side navigation bar that appears.

. In the *Edit User* interface, edit the basic user information.
+
You can change the _<<username,username>>_, _<<display-name,display name>>_, _<<sharing-visibility,sharing visibility>>_, and _<<email,user's email>>_.
+

[#edit-user-activation-status]
=== Manage activation status
You can view the activation status of users created in ThoughtSpot, and resend the activation email to users who are not yet active.

The *Account Activation* column in the *Users* page of the Admin Console tells you the status of your users. If a user received the activation email, set up their account, and logged in to ThoughtSpot at least once, their status in *Account Activation* is *ACTIVE*. If a user received the activation email but did not yet set up their account, their status is *PENDING*.

If a user's status is *PENDING*, you can send them the activation email again. Use this feature if the activation link in their original email expires. In the *Account Activation* column for the user, select *Resend activation email*.

[#delete-user]
== Delete users

To delete users, follow these steps:

. Navigate to the Admin Console by selecting the *Admin* tab from the top navigation bar.
. Select *Users* from the side navigation bar that appears.
+
image::admin-portal-users-new.png[Admin Console - Users]

. Select the users you plan to delete by selecting the box next to the username.
+
If you don't immediately see the username you plan to delete, use the search bar in the upper-right corner of the Admin Console.

. Select *Delete* in the upper-left corner.
