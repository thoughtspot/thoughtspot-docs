:description: Learn how to delete a table from an Amazon Athena connection.

Whenever you try to remove a table in a connection, ThoughtSpot checks for dependencies and shows a list of dependent objects.
You can select the listed objects to delete them or remove the dependency.
Then you can remove the table.

To delete a table from an {connection} connection:

ifndef::spotter[]
. Select *Data* in the top navigation bar.
. Open the *Connections* tab in the left navigation bar.
endif::[]
ifdef::spotter[]
. Click the app switcher menu image:spotter-app-switcher.png[Spotter app switcher] and then click *{form-factor}*.
. On the left side of the screen, select *Manage data > Manage data sources*.
. On the _Data workspace_ page, click *Connections*.
endif::[]
. Select the name of the connection that contains the table you want to delete.
. Find the table you want to delete in the list, and select the checkbox next to its name.
. Click *Delete*, and then select *Delete* again to confirm.

If you attempt to delete a table with dependent objects, the operation is blocked.
A _Cannot delete_ window appears, with a list of links to dependent objects.
See xref:connections-amazon-athena-delete-table-dependencies.adoc[Delete a table with dependent objects].

See the xref:connections-amazon-athena-reference.adoc[Connection reference] for details of connection parameters.
