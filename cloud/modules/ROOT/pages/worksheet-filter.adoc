You can add filters to a Worksheet to limit the data it contains.
This is useful when you have underlying tables that store more data than is necessary for the types of analyses the Worksheet is intended for.
You can also use Worksheet filters to provide data security, when you want different groups of users to be able to see different data without relying on row-level security.

To add a filter to a Worksheet:

. Select *Data* in the top menu bar, find your Worksheet, and select its name.
. Select the *Edit Worksheet* button.

If there are too many values, you can use the filter search bar to find the ones you want.

****
Previously, any filter defined at the Model or Worksheet level applied to every query based on that Model or Worksheet. Now, you can define which table a filter applies to in the Model or Worksheet TML. Once defined, the filter only applies to queries that include columns from that specific table.
