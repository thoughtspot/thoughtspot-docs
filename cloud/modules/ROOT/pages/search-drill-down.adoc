When you drill down, you can see more information about the data within your search.
You can drill down into a datapoint to get a finer grained view of that datapoint and the data behind it.
Move easily from a general view of your information to a more specific representation of the data behind a datapoint at a click.
For example, in a *revenue by department* search, you may notice that your *clothing* department has the highest revenue.
You can drill down on *clothing* by *product name* to find out which products contribute to those high sales.
There is no limit to how deep you can drill down.

You can drill down in both tables and chart visualizations, on both <<answer-drilldown,standalone Answers>> and on <<pinboard-drilldown,Answers within Liveboards>>.
When you drill down on Answers within Liveboards, you can either drill down directly, or drill down <<explorer-drilldown,using the Answer Explorer view>>.
xref:answer-explorer.adoc[Answer Explorer] provides a flexible, AI-guided exploration of an Answer within a Liveboard.

== Drill down on an Answer

. Right-click the chart object (such as a column on a bar chart, or a section of a donut chart) or data point of interest in your Answer.
. Select *Drill down*.
+
This limits the data you are exploring to that particular data point or chart object.

. A list of attributes and measures appears.
You can drill down by both measures and attributes in the xref:answer-experience-new.adoc[Answer].
Select any of the options to gain deeper insight into your data.

For example, if you choose to drill down on _dairy_ by _product full name_, the following chart appears, showing dairy sales by product:
+

+
To go back or forward one step at a time, use the in-product back button to the right of the search bar.
+
NOTE: Your browser's back button only goes back one step on unsaved Answers, and does not work.
If you are working with a saved Answer, selecting your browser's back button prompts you to save your unsaved changes, and does not take you back to the previous step in your Drill down.

+
You can continue to drill down in the data until you run out of relevant dimensions.

[#pinboard-drilldown]
== Drill down within a Liveboard

When you drill down on an Answer within a Liveboard, it works similarly to drilling down on the Answer itself.
You can go back one step at a time using the xref:liveboard.adoc#back-button[in-product back button].
To return to the original Answer, select the reset icon. The reset icon is part of the back button, and appears when you select the back button dropdown menu.

[#explorer-drilldown]
== Drill down with Answer Explorer

You can also drill down using the xref:answer-explorer.adoc[Answer Explorer] feature.
Answer Explorer provides AI-guided exploration of an Answer within a Liveboard.
If you drill down with Answer Explorer, or on an Answer or search that is not part of a Liveboard, you can use the _go back one step_ feature.

As you drill down on an Answer using Answer Explorer, use the back arrow image:icon-arrow-left-10px.png[Left arrow icon image] to go back one step at a time.
Select the reset icon image:icon-reset-10px.png[Reset icon image] to go back to the original Answer.

If you want to go back one step at a time while drilling down, either drill down on an Answer or search that is not part of a Liveboard, or xref:liveboard.adoc#add-answer[add your Answer to a Liveboard] so you can use Answer Explorer.

== Drill down on a date column

When you add a date filter to a search that includes a date column, ThoughtSpot's natural behavior is to override the date column. If you want to preserve the date column in your search, we recommend creating a formula that contains the date column, then adding the filter.

For example, consider a search for `revenue` `commit date month of year` `commit date between 01/01/1991 and 01/01/1993`. If you then filter on `month of year = 2` `by ship mode`, the commit date column is removed from your search. If you create a formula defining commit date as between 01/01/1991 and 01/01/1993, then add the filter for `month of year = 2`, then the commit date data remains in your search.

== Save and share your new Answer

When you find a valuable insight using Drill down, you may want to save that Answer instead of trying to recreate it in the *Search* bar later.

. Select the *More* icon image:icon-more-10px.png[More menu icon].
. Select *Make a copy*.
. *Save* your new Answer and continue working with it.
. Alternatively, select *Download* to download an image of your current visualization.

You can also xref:share-answers.adoc[share the Answer] by selecting the sharing icon image:icon-share-10px.png[Share icon image].
Otherwise, the Answer returns to its original state when you exit the page.

== Share your data

If you own a Liveboard or Answer, you can drill down to the data beneath.
Users you share a Liveboard or Answer with can also drill down provided they _also_ have access to the data on which the board was based.
If you do not have access to a Liveboard or Answer's underlying data source, you cannot drill down.
See xref:sharing.adoc[Overview of sharing] to share your Answers, Liveboards, or data.
