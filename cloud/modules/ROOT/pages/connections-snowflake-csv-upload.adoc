:description: You can upload a CSV file that will become a table you can join to existing tables in your Snowflake connection.

.[.badge.badge-beta]#Beta#
****
This feature is in Beta and off by default. To enable it, contact {support-url}.
****

You can upload a CSV file that will become a table you can join to existing tables in your Snowflake connection. When uploaded, the data goes to memory and is then pushed to Snowflake. No uploaded CSV data is stored in ThoughtSpot.

== Prerequisites

- Before you can upload a CSV file in your {connection} connection, CSV Upload must be configured for your Snowflake connection. This must be done by an administrator for your ThoughtSpot cluster.
+
For details, see xref:connections-snowflake-csv-upload-config.adoc[Configure CSV upload for your {connection} connection].


- To upload a CSV file, you must have the
*Can Manage Data* privilege and have the appropriate write permissions in the {connection} database

== Uploading a CSV file in your {connection} connection

To upload a CSV file to your {connection} connection:

. Select *Data* in the top navigation bar.
. Select the *Utilities* tab in the left navigation bar
. In the Upload CSV tile, select *Upload CSV*.

. In the Upload Data window, click *Browse Files* and select your CSV file or drag your CSV file into the window.
. For *Column Names* and *Fields Separation*, make any changes necessary.
+
.When multiple connections have CSV Upload enabled
****
If there are multiple Snowflake connections in your cluster that have CSV Upload enabled, you will see *Do you want this table to be colocated with other tables/worksheets?* at the bottom of the Upload Data window.

If so, this means that you have the option of choosing a table or Worksheet you plan to join with your imported table after you upload it.

If you choose *Yes* and select a table or Worksheet, your table will be imported into the same Snowflake database as that table or Worksheet, making it easy to set up a join later.
****
+
If you see *Do you want this table to be colocated with other tables/worksheets?* at the bottom of the Upload Data window, go to the next step. If not, skip to step 7.

. Choose whether you want to import your into the same Snowflake database as an existing table or Worksheet:
+
_If you want to import into the same database as an existing table or worksheet_:

.. Select *Yes*.
.. Open the *select source here* menu, and select the table or Worksheet you plan to join your imported table to.
+
NOTE: If you see tables and Worksheets that are greyed out, it means those are not currently shared with you.
+
_If you don't want to import into the same database as an existing table or worksheet_:

* Select *No*.

. Select *Next*.
. In the Review and upload data page, review the data to correct any errors and make any changes necessary before uploading.
. Select *Upload*.
+
The data is written into the appropriate database and schema. When the upload is complete, a success message appears which confirms the number of rows that were imported.

. At this point, you have the option to either join the data you uploaded with existing data or start searching the data.

* To join the data with existing data, select *Join with existing data*
** This takes you to the table you imported, where you can add joins.
** If you want to load more data into the imported table, select *Load Data*.
+
This takes you to the Upload Data window where you have the option to append data to the table or overwrite the data completely.
* To search the data you uploaded, select *Start search on your data*.
