Using scheduled alerts, you can define a time period to receive notifications on your KPI.

NOTE: You can create alerts directly from watchlist KPIs on the home page.

To schedule a repeated notification for changes in your KPI, follow these steps:

. Select the KPI you want to monitor, either by accessing a Liveboard, or by searching within the **Answers** tab. +
Optionally, create a KPI and save it as an Answer, then select **Create alert** from the **more options** menu.

. Hover over the KPI visualization and select the **Monitor** icon.

. The pop-up **Select an alert type** window appears.

. Select *Regular KPI updates*. Click *Next*.
. Under **How often**, choose whether to receive an alert notification hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly.
.. If *Every N minutes*, enter a minute interval to receive an alert notification ** Every _N_ minutes**.
.. If **Hourly**, enter an hour interval to receive an alert notification ** Every _n_ hours**.
.. If **Daily**, select a time of day to receive an alert notification. ThoughtSpot displays the time zone in which your cluster deploys. [Optional] Choose whether to receive an alert notification on weekends.
.. If **Weekly**, choose a minimum of one weekday to receive an alert notification. Select a time of day to receive an alert notification as per your desired timezone.
.. If **Monthly**, choose a minimum of one date to receive an alert notification. +
Enter the date as a numerical value or a comma-separated list (for example, "5, 10, 15" to receive an alert on the fifth, tenth and fifteenth of each month). Select a time of day to receive an alert notification as per your desired timezone.
. Your name automatically appears under **Subscribers**. Enter the names of one or more teammates to subscribe them to your KPI alert schedule.
+
NOTE: You must have _view_ access to the data source underlying the KPI to schedule notifications for teammates who also have _view_ access to the data source. You must have _edit_ access to the data source underlying the KPI to schedule notifications for teammates regardless of whether they have access to the data source.

. [Optional] Select the checkbox next to *Add custom message* and type your custom message in the text box.


. Select **Save**.
