:description: Learn how to specify which Liveboard visualizations a Liveboard filter should apply to.



include::partial$liveboard-experience-new-announcement.adoc[]

When you create or view a Liveboard, you may want to filter the visualizations on the Liveboard, to only see data that is relevant to your role, for example.
However, you may not want a filter to apply to every visualization or tab in the Liveboard.
For example, the head of sales in North America may want to filter most visualizations to only contain data about sales in North America, but may want to compare her sales to an unfiltered _global quarterly sales_ metric.

You can apply Liveboard filters to specific visualizations or tabs from the Filters modal.

To learn more about Liveboard filters, refer to xref:liveboard-filters.adoc[Liveboard filters] and xref:liveboard-filters-linked.adoc[Linked Liveboard filters].

== Configure selective filters

. Navigate to the Liveboard you would like to filter, or xref:liveboard-compose.adoc[create a new Liveboard].
. Select the *Edit* button at the upper right of the Liveboard. If this button is grayed out, you do not have edit privileges for the Liveboard. To resolve this, contact your administrator or the creator of the Liveboard.
. In the top menu bar, select *Add filter*. If you already created the filter you would like to modify, click on the filter in the filters bar below the Liveboard name, and proceed to step 5.
. In the *Add filters* side panel, you see a list of columns. Click the filter icon image:icon-filter-10px.png[Filter icon image] next to the column you would like to selectively filter on.
. Specify values to include or exclude, if you did not already specify them.
. Select *Applicable to* from the filters modal side menu.
You can select or unselect entire tabs, or only choose certain visualizations.
You can also search for a visualization.
