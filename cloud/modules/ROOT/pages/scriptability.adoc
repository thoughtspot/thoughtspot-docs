:description: Export and import Worksheets, views, SQL Views, tables, Liveboards, Monitor alerts, and Answers in a human-readable format.



Use ThoughtSpot Modeling Language (TML) to export and import Worksheets, views, tables, Liveboards, Monitor alerts, and Answers in a human-readable format.

ThoughtSpot developed its own scriptable approach for exporting, enhancing, and migrating Worksheets, views, tables, Liveboards, Monitor alerts, and Answers.

You can model your data and build out sophisticated dashboards in your test environment, before deploying to all users.

ThoughtSpot Modeling Language supports several scenarios that you may encounter:

* *Migrating from a development environment to a production environment* by downloading files from the development cluster and uploading the same files into the production cluster
* *Implementing metadata changes outside the ThoughtSpot UI*, such as replacing the underlying tables for an object, or replacing a single column from one table with a column in another table
* *Making bulk changes*, such as mass renaming of objects defined by Worksheets, and managing duplicates
* *Reusing existing objects to build new objects*, such as building two very similar objects based on a similar, pre-existing object.

== How to use TML files

Depending on how you want to migrate or change your files, there are several workflows you can follow:

. *Edit and update an existing object in the same cluster*: You can either
 ** <<export-object,export>> the object(s), edit the object(s) by modifying its xref:tml.adoc[ThoughtSpot Modeling Language] (`TML`) representation, and <<update-object,import>> the updated file(s) to modify the existing object _or_
 ** edit the object(s) using the <<edit-tml,in-app `TML` editor>> and publish the updated file(s).
. *Migrate an existing object from one cluster to a new cluster*: <<export-object,export>> the object(s) and <<migrate-object,import>> the updated file(s) to the new cluster.
. *Edit and migrate an existing object from one cluster to a new cluster*: You can either
 ** <<export-object,export>> the object(s), edit the object(s) by modifying its xref:tml.adoc[ThoughtSpot Modeling Language] (`TML`) representation, and <<migrate-object,import>> the updated file(s) to the new cluster _or_
 ** edit the object(s) using the <<edit-tml,in-app `TML` editor>>, publish the updated file(s), <<export-object,export>> the object(s), and <<migrate-object,import>> the updated file(s) to the new cluster.
Note that this workflow changes the object(s) in both clusters.

== Prerequisites

You may notice that you don't see options to Import, Export, or Edit TML for certain objects. If you don't have the required permissions to import, export, or edit the TML for an object, you won't see TML options for that object.

Refer to the following tables for required permissions for importing, editing, and exporting the TML for Liveboards, Answers, Worksheets, tables, and views.

[#import-permissions]
*Import*

|===
| Import and create a new object without importing its dependents | Import and create a new object and its dependents | Import and update an existing object without dependents | Import and update an existing object with dependents

| The dependents must already exist in the cluster.
You must have *view* permissions for the first-level dependent.
For example, if you import a Liveboard that is built on a Worksheet that is built on a table, you must have *view* permission for the Worksheet.
When importing a new Worksheet or view, you must have the *can manage data* permission.
| *Can manage data*, if the object or any of its dependents is a Worksheet or view.
| *Edit* permission on the existing object.
The dependents must already exist in the cluster.
You must have *view* permissions for the first-level dependent.
When importing a Worksheet or view, you must have the *can manage data* permission.
| *Edit* permission on the existing object(s).
*Can manage data*, if the object or any of its dependents is a Worksheet or view.
|===

[#export-permissions]
*Export*

|===
| Export with dependents | Export without dependents

| *View* permission on the object and all dependents.
| *View* permission on the object and its first-level dependents.
|===

[NOTE]
====
If you have a permissions issue with a particular object when you export multiple objects, or an object and its dependents, the complete export does not fail.

The individual object does not export, and you receive an error message about this failure in the `Manifest` file in the zip file.
====

*Edit*

To edit TML for an object using the in-product TML editor, you must have the permissions required to both export the object and to import and update the object, as listed in the <<import-permissions,import>> and <<export-permissions,export>> permissions.

[#export-object]
== Export an object

You can export one object at a time or export more than one object as a zip file.
The zip file contains a document called the `Manifest` file, which defines the objects you exported, and their underlying data sources.

The zip file also contains the `Alerts.tml` file, which only appears when you export an Answer or Liveboard and its associated objects. The `Alerts.tml` file defines the KPI Monitor alerts associated with the object. If you have administrator privileges, you see every alert for the object. Otherwise, you see only the alerts you created.

To export custom collections of related TML files, refer to xref:tml-import-export-multiple.adoc#export-multiple[Migrate multiple TML files].

////
{: id="export-one"}
### Export one object
To export one object:

1. Navigate to the Liveboard, Answer, View, table, or Worksheet you want to export.

2. Click the three-dot icon, and select **Export TML**.

[#export-zip-file]
=== How to export objects

To export objects, follow these steps.
To export custom collections of related TML files, refer to xref:tml-import-export-multiple.adoc#export-multiple[Migrate multiple TML files].

. Navigate to the *Answers*, *Liveboards*, or *Data* page from the top navigation bar, depending on the object(s) you want to export.
+
image::nav-bar-no-spotiq.png[The top navigation bar]

. Hover over the object(s) you want to export, and select the empty checkboxes that appear.
. Select the *Export TML* button.
+
image::scriptability-cloud-export-multiple.png[Export multiple objects]

. Choose whether to export only the objects, or the objects and their underlying data sources (worksheets, tables, and views). To download any KPI Monitor alerts for the object, you must export the associated objects. The `Alerts.tml` file in the zip file that downloads defines any KPI Monitor alerts associated with the objects. If you have administrator privileges, you see every alert for the objects. Otherwise, you see only the alerts you created. Choose whether to export the table and connection FQNs. If you select this option, the TML file contains FQNs for the underlying tables and connections.
If you export a table, you do not see the *Choose what to export* modal, since tables do not have any dependents.
+
image::tml-export-with-fqn.png[Choose what to export]

. Select *Export*.

. Open the downloaded `TML` zip file.
The zip file contains a document called the `Manifest` file, which defines the objects you exported, their underlying data sources, and any export errors.
If an individual export fails, you can find an error message in the `Manifest` file.
The zip file still exports, even if an individual object's export fails.

[#edit-tml]
== Edit the TML file

You can edit the `TML` file in one of two ways.
You can <<export-object,export>> the object(s) and edit the file(s) in any text editor, before you import it.
Or, you can use the <<tml-editor,in-app `TML` editor>> to edit, validate, and publish the object(s).
Refer to xref:tml.adoc[ThoughtSpot Modeling Language] for information on syntax in the TML files.

[#tml-editor]
== Edit, validate, and publish objects using the TML editor

You can access the TML editor from the object list page
// , or from the object itself. To edit and update multiple objects using the TML editor, access it from the object list page
. It also appears when there is an error when you import TML objects, if you select *Edit*.

To use the TML editor, follow these steps:

. Navigate to the *Answers*, *Liveboards*, or *Data* page from the top navigation bar, depending on the object you want to update.
. {blank}
+
// Click the name of the object you want to edit, or
+
Select one or more objects by selecting the checkboxes that appear when you hover over an object name.
. From the object list page, select the *Edit TML* button.
// From the object itself, select the ellipsis ![more options menu]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/icon-more-10px.png){: .inline} (more options) menu in the upper-right side of the screen, and select **Edit TML**.
+
image::scriptability-edit-tml-object-page.png[Edit TML - object list page]
+
// [Edit TML from object]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/scriptability-edit-tml-object.png "Edit TML from object")

. The TML editor opens.
Edit the TML file(s), using the syntax specified in xref:tml.adoc[ThoughtSpot Modeling Language].
+
The TML editor has the following functions in the top menu:

 ** *File*: Validate, Publish, and Exit editor.
You can also validate and publish using the *validate* and *publish* buttons at the upper right of the editor.
You can also exit the editor using the X button at the upper-right corner.
The system warns you if you try to exit with unsaved changes.
 ** *Edit*: Undo, Redo, Cut, Copy, Select all, Fold, Fold all, Unfold, Unfold all, and Go to line.
The *Fold* option compresses the lines in the file so you only see the first line of a section.
*Go to line* opens a dialog, where you can type in the number of the line you would like to go to.
This is useful for long TML files.
 ** *Find*: Find and Find and replace.
This functionality allows you to easily find words or parameters in the TML file.
You can also select a word or parameter in the TML editor, and the editor highlights all instances of that word.
 ** *View*: Show/Hide errors, Show line numbers, and Hide line numbers.
*Show/Hide errors* toggles the *Errors* sidebar on and off.
The *Errors* sidebar does not appear until after you Validate a file, if there are errors in it.
 ** *Help*: Documentation.
This links to the xref:tml.adoc[ThoughtSpot Modeling Language] documentation.
** *Show FQNs of referenced objects*: This toggle appears to the left of the *Validate* and *Publish* buttons. If you enable it, the TML editor includes the fully qualified names (FQNs) for the objects' underlying tables and connections. Use this option to reduce ambiguity and identify a specific table or connection when editing or migrating files. For more information about FQNs in TML, see xref:tml.adoc#fqn[ThoughtSpot Modeling Language].

. When you finish editing the TML file(s), select *Validate* in the upper-right corner.
You must validate each file individually.
A blue dot appears next to any file that contains changes.
+
image::scriptability-tml-editor-validate.png[Validate the file]

. If you constructed the file(s) correctly, a green check mark appears next to the name of the file.
If you did not construct the file correctly, a red bar appears near the top of the screen, telling you that ThoughtSpot found errors in one or more files.
Select *Show errors* to see the errors listed in the *Errors* sidebar.
+
image::scriptability-tml-editor-errors.png[Review errors]

. After validating,  select *Publish* in the upper-right corner, next to *Validate*.
You must publish each file individually.
. The system displays a *Publish status* dialog box.
You can select *Open [object]* to open the object you just published in a new tab, or select *Close* to return to the TML editor.
+

[#update-object]
== Update an object

You can overwrite an existing Worksheet, view, table, Answer, or Liveboard, by downloading the `TML` file, making any necessary changes, and then re-uploading the `TML` file.
To update collections of objects packaged together as a zip file, refer to xref:tml-import-export-multiple.adoc[Migrate multiple TML files].

You can also update an object using the <<tml-editor,TML editor>>.

To update an existing object by downloading the TML file and modifying it, follow these steps.
In this case, we are updating a single Worksheet.
You can update multiple objects at once by uploading them in .zip file format.

. <<export-object,Export the object>> you want to update, as in steps 1 to 5 of the <<export-object,Export an Object>> section.
. Edit the file in a text editor.
. Navigate to the *Answers*, *Liveboards*, or *Data* page from the top navigation bar, depending on the object you want to update.
. Select *Import TML*.
+
////
Here, we are uploading the edited *TCPH WS* worksheet.

![Start Worksheet update from file]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/scriptability-worksheet-update.png "Start Worksheet update from file")
////
. In the *Import* interface, click *Select .tml or .zip files to upload*.
+
image::scriptability-worksheet-update-browse.png[Find the Worksheet TML file]

. In your file system, find and select the `TML` file you edited.
. If you uploaded a `.zip` file with multiple objects, you can deselect any files in the `.zip` file you don't want to upload.
. The *Import* interface recognizes that an object with this GUID already exists in the system, and asks if you would like to create a new object, or update the existing one.
Select *Update existing [object]*.
. If there are errors in any of the objects you are importing, the *Status* column for the object is one of two states:
+
* *Ready for import* and *View Warnings*, with a yellow exclamation mark: The object contains errors, but you can still import it. Either some visualizations or filters in the Liveboard have errors, or the destination tables for some joins in the table don't exist. If you import the object without fixing the errors, the object removes the Liveboard visualizations or filters or table joins that contain errors. To view the errors, select *View Warnings*.

* *Cannot import* and *View Errors*, with a red exclamation mark: The object contains errors, and you cannot import it. You must fix the errors. To view the errors and a suggested resolution, select *View Errors*.
. Resolve any errors by selecting the *Edit* button for the object with errors.
This opens the <<tml-editor,TML editor>>.
Within the editor, resolve the errors using the method suggested under *View Errors* in the Import workflow.
. After you resolve the errors, select *Validate*, and then *Save*.
Exit the TML editor.
. Select the objects you want to import.
ThoughtSpot automatically selects objects with no errors, but does not select objects with errors, even after you resolve them.
You must select the objects yourself.
. Select *Import selected*.
. The *Import Status* screen displays the status of the objects you imported.
You can open the object(s) that you imported, or select *Exit* to return to the main object page.

[#migrate-object]
== Migrate an object

To migrate an Answer, Liveboard, view, or Worksheet from one cluster to another, follow these steps.
To migrate collections of objects packaged together as a zip file, refer to xref:tml-import-export-multiple.adoc[Migrate multiple TML files].
Note that you cannot create a new table using TML.
You can only update existing tables.

. <<export-object,Export the object>> you want to move, as in steps 1 to 5 of the <<export-object,Export an Object>> section.
+
The object remains on the original cluster as well, unless you delete it.

. Navigate to the cluster you want to add the object to.
. Select *Answers*, *Liveboards*, or *Data* on the top navigation bar, depending on the objects you want to migrate.
. To upload a Worksheet or view, select the *More* icon image:icon-more-10px.png[more options menu] in the upper-right side of the screen.
Then, select *Import TML*.
+
image::scriptability-cloud-worksheet-view-import.png[Import Worksheet or View TML]

. To upload a Liveboard or Answer, select the *Import TML* button in the upper-right side of the screen.
+

. In the *Import* interface, click *Select .tml or .zip files to upload*.
. In your file system, find and select the `TML` file.
The file uploads automatically.
. If you constructed the file correctly, the *Import* interface displays a _Validation successful_ message.
You can now import the file.
. If you uploaded a `.zip` file with multiple objects, you can deselect any files in the `.zip` file you don't want to upload.
. If there are errors in any of the objects you are importing, the *Status* column for the object is one of two states:
+
* *Ready for import* and *View Warnings*, with a yellow exclamation mark: The object contains errors, but you can still import it. Either some visualizations in the Liveboard have errors, or the destination tables for some joins in the table don't exist. If you import the object without fixing the errors, the object removes the Liveboard visualizations or table joins that contain errors. To view the errors, select *View Warnings*.

* *Cannot import* and *View Errors*, with a red exclamation mark: The object contains errors, and you cannot import it. You must fix the errors. To view the errors and a suggested resolution, select *View Errors*.
. Resolve any errors by selecting the *Edit* button for the object with errors.
This opens the <<tml-editor,TML editor>>.
Within the editor, resolve the errors using the method suggested under *View Errors* in the Import workflow.
. After you resolve the errors, select *Validate*, and then *Save*.
Exit the TML editor.
. Select the objects you want to import.
ThoughtSpot automatically selects objects with no errors, but does not select objects with errors, even after you resolve them.
You must select the objects yourself.
. Select *Import selected*.
. The *Import Status* screen displays the status of the objects you imported.
You can open the object(s) that you imported, or select *Exit* to return to the main object page.

[#delete]
== Deleting columns, joins, and RLS rules
You can delete joins at the table level, table RLS rules, and table, Worksheet, View, and SQL View columns. However, keep in mind the following behaviors:

* To delete a column or join, you must first remove its dependents. If you are deleting a column, you can delete it and remove that column's dependencies in the same zip file import.

* If the deletion of a column fails, the whole import, including any other objects in a zip file, will fail.

* Joins only appear in the table TML file of the source table in a join, or the table on the Many side of a Many-to-One join.
You can only add and edit table joins from the TML file of the table on the Many side of the join.
You can't view or modify table-level joins from the destination table's TML file.

* You can't modify joins at the table level from the Worksheet, view, or Answer TML file.
You can only override the joins for that specific Worksheet, view, or Answer.
To modify table-level joins, you must edit the source table's TML file.

== Limitations of working with TML files

There are certain limitations to the changes you can apply by editing a Worksheet, Answer, table, view, or Liveboard through TML.
