Liveboards act like live dashboards.
They are collections of your related charts, tables, and headline.

== What are Liveboards

You can pin charts and tables to any Liveboard which you created, and those that have been shared with you with the *Edit* privilege.
When you create a Liveboard, you can share it with other people with either the *View* or *Edit* privilege.
Liveboards are interactive, allowing you to perform actions like filtering, excluding values, and drill down on the visualizations.

== Create a Liveboard

To create a Liveboard:

. Click *Liveboards*, on the top navigation bar.

Then click *Create*.

== Add an answer to a Liveboard

Instead of saving an answer you can add it to a Liveboard.
To add an answer to a Liveboard:

. While viewing your answer of interest, click the *Pin* icon at the top right of the answer.

You can also select *Create new Liveboard* at the top of the list to create a new Liveboard, then add your answer to it.

== Download a Liveboard

You can download a Liveboard as a PDF file, without having to download each visualization separately.
Downloading a Liveboard works just as it would when downloading an answer: simply click the ellipses icon image:icon-ellipses.png[more options menu icon] and select *Download as PDF*.

== Other Liveboard actions

Other Liveboard actions include actions you normally perform on your search as well as actions that you can only perform on a Liveboard.
Most of these actions are found under the *Actions* button.

Other actions are available on a Liveboard display itself.
Some actions always appear, while others appear only when you hover over specific locations of the Liveboard.
This diagram displays active action areas on a Liveboard.

If you make a change to a Liveboard, the system recognizes this and displays an alert message with a *Save changes* button at the top of the page.
Click this button to make your changes permanent.
