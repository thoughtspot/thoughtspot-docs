:description: Create a new Liveboard to group and manage related search results. Liveboards are the ThoughtSpot term for a dashboard.



Liveboards act like live dashboards.
They are collections of your related charts, tables, and headlines.

== What are Liveboards

You can pin charts and tables to any Liveboard which you created, and those that have been shared with you with the *Edit* privilege.
When you create a Liveboard, you can share it with other people with either the *View* or *Edit* privilege. You can collaborate with other users on a Liveboard by commenting and reacting to comments.
Liveboards are interactive, allowing you to perform actions like filtering, excluding values, and drill down on the visualizations.

[#create-a-liveboard]

[#add-answer]
== Add an Answer to a Liveboard

Instead of saving an Answer you can add it to a Liveboard.
To add an Answer to a Liveboard:

. While viewing your Answer of interest, select the *Pin* button at the upper right of the Answer. The *Pin* button may have a Liveboard or Liveboard tab name next to it. Select *Pin* to quickly pin the Answer to that Liveboard or Liveboard tab. Select the dropdown menu to pin the Answer to a different Liveboard.

. In the *Pin to Liveboard* dialog, select the name of the Liveboard you would like to add your Answer to.
+

. If the Liveboard has multiple tabs, there is an arrow *>* symbol next to the Liveboard name. When you select the Liveboard, you can choose a tab to pin to, or create a new tab by selecting *+ Create tab*.
+

. Select *Pin*.
+
You can also select *Create Liveboard* at the top of the list of Liveboards to create a new Liveboard, then add your Answer to it.

== Download a Liveboard

You can download a Liveboard as a PDF file, without having to download each visualization separately.
Downloading a Liveboard works just as it would when downloading an Answer: simply select the *More* menu image:icon-more-10px.png[more options menu icon] and select *Download as PDF*.

For more details, see xref:liveboard-download-pdf.adoc[Download a Liveboard as PDF].

NOTE: If you do not see this option, your company may have removed the Liveboard download option.
If you would like to download Liveboards, contact your ThoughtSpot administrator.

*Comment on a Liveboard*

Commenting on Liveboards is in Early Access and off by default. To enable this feature, contact your administrator.

You can comment on data points in a Liveboard to bring information to the attention of your teammates. To add a comment to a Liveboard, click the *Comment* icon image:comment-icon.png[comment icon] to the left of the *More* menu icon image:icon-more-10px.png[Ellipsis icon]. All previous comments appear in the right sidebar.

After clicking *Comment*, you can hover over the data point you'd like to comment on, and click it to begin typing your comment. You can tag other users using the @ symbol. Users can reply to comments by clicking on the comment in the sidebar, and selecting the *Reply* section below the comment.

Data in a Liveboard may change after you add a comment. ThoughtSpot stores the data point at the time you commented. To see the original data behind a comment, click on the data point below the comment.

== Details about a Liveboard

[#liveboard-usage]
== View Liveboard usage

You can see who viewed or interacted with a Liveboard within the last 120 days. To the upper right of the Liveboard, next to the share and schedule icon, select the list of names and user icons.

[#edit-mode]
== Edit a Liveboard
If you are using the xref:liveboard-experience-new.adoc[new Liveboard experience], you must enter *Edit mode* to make changes to the Liveboard. This includes adding filters, adding tabs, and changing the layout. You do not need to enter edit mode to change the name of the Liveboard or Liveboard visualizations.

To enter edit mode, select the *Edit* button at the upper right of the Liveboard. If this button is grayed out, you do not have edit privileges for the Liveboard. To resolve this, contact your administrator or the creator of the Liveboard.

[#liveboard-tabs]

To learn more about Liveboard tabs, refer to xref:liveboard-tabs.adoc[Liveboard tabs].

[#back-button]
== Undo, redo, and reset buttons
As you work with Liveboard visualizations, you may want to undo or redo an action. Use the in-product undo, redo, and reset buttons to reset or go back or forward 1 step each time you make a change in a search, saved Answer, or Liveboard visualization (for example, when you drill down, or sort). These buttons appear to the left of the *Explore* button in a Liveboard visualization. Note that the reset button is only available for saved Answers and visualizations; it resets the Answer to its last saved state.

== Other Liveboard actions

Other Liveboard actions include actions you normally perform on your search as well as actions that you can only perform on a Liveboard.
You can see these options when you select the *More* menu icon image:icon-more-10px.png[more options menu icon] in the upper-right corner of the Liveboard. Note that there are different options in the more menu for the Liveboard, depending on whether you are in *view* or <<edit-mode,edit>> mode.
