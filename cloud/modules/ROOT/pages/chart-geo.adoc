:description: Use geo area, geo bubble, and geo heatmap charts to visualize geographical data in ThoughtSpot.

Geo charts show data on a map by location.
There are three geo charts that let you visualize geographical data in ThoughtSpot: xref:chart-geo-area.adoc[geo area], xref:chart-geo-bubble.adoc[geo bubble], and xref:chart-geo-heatmap.adoc[geo heatmap] charts.
These geo charts can display six types of geographical data, depending on territory:

* Country
* State
* County
* Zip code
* Point (latitude/longitude)
* Other sub-nation regions (for international countries)

ThoughtSpot supports maps for many countries. See the complete list in xref:geomap-reference.adoc[Geo map reference]. If you would like to use a custom map to visualize your data, see xref:geomaps-custom.adoc[].

== Displayed geo data

Here is a table that shows which GeoType data can be displayed using which geo chart type.

|===

| Country
| VARCHAR
| Geo area (default), geo bubble, geo heatmap
| Can also be regions.

| County

| Only for counties in the United States.

| Latitude (point)

For data to display in geo charts, your administrator must configure it as geographical data.
If you don't get an expected map visualization, contact your administrator so they can configure the system correctly.
