This example will walk you through how to create a simple scatterplot where you’re comparing (x,y) values of two continuous fields to identify patterns or correlations in your data.


1. Add a continuous, non-aggregated field to *Columns*. Because measures are aggregated by default, you’ll need to click the caret of that field to open its settings. In the context menu, you’ll see the option to select `No Aggregate`.

2. Similarly, add another continuous, non-aggregated field to *Rows*.

3. If it isn’t already, make sure to set your Mark Type to `Circle`.
