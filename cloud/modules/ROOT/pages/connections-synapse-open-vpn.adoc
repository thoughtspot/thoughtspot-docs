Learn how to configure secure access from ThoughtSpot Cloud to your data in Azure {connection} or Snowflake on Azure, through your OpenVPN server.

You can make your data in Azure {connection} or Snowflake on Azure even more secure by connecting to your OpenVPN server.
This feature is also available for data in xref:connections-gbq-open-vpn.adoc[Google BigQuery].

Your company may have a policy that prohibits exposing your cloud data to the internet.
In this case, you can set up a VPN connection between your ThoughtSpot Cloud cluster and your data warehouse, either Google BigQuery, Snowflake, or Azure {connection}.

ThoughtSpot supports the following 3 OpenVPN servers:
