[#tables]
=== Tables

Tables present data in a format that is highly adaptable and easily understandable for end users.
Users have two ways to create new tables.
One approach involves selecting the table chart from the green *Add Chart* dropdown located above the query editor by clicking on it.

[.bordered]
image::addtableabovequery.png[add chart]

Another option is to find the query with the data you want to display, click the *+* button under it, and select the table chart.

[.bordered]
image::addtable.png[add chart]

The initial step for creating a table is to add desired columns from the *Dimensions* and *Measures* fields to the *Columns* section.
This can be accomplished by using the drag-and-drop method or by using the typeahead search option.
Additionally, it is possible to include columns that are intended for use as filters within the *Filters* section.
Column formatting options are available in the toolbar above the table.

[.bordered]
image::charttoolbar.png[toolbar]

* *Sort settings*
+
The user can sort any field in the Flat Table by ascending or descending order.
The sorting hierarchy can be defined by specifying primary and secondary sort fields, or more levels if needed in the chart designer, Report View and Explorations.
+
Sort settings can be found in the field context menu or on the toolbar for chart designer and Explorations.
In the Report View, it can be found in the field context menu.
+
[.bordered]
image::sort-settings.png[sort settings]

+
image::url-construction-demo.gif[url construction demo]

* The reference field used as the URL address can be any field in the underlying data and has to be added to the Flat Table.

==== *Size to fit*

The columns of the table are optimally sized to fit the chart designer by default.
This option can be changed to manually size to update the column size based on user preferences.

==== *Export Tables as CSV*

Tables with Report filters, chart filters or sorts applied can be exported as CSV files from the Quick Chart Table designer, Explorations, and the Report View.
There is a 300,000 row limit on the tables that can be exported.
Tables that are above this limit will be truncated.

In the Quick Chart Table designer, the *Export to CSV* option is enabled in the toolbar when fields are added to the Flat Table.

The number of rows shown per page can be customized by adding any number between 1 and 1000 in the input box located in the bottom right corner.
The page size can be updated in the chart designer or Explorations.

[.bordered]
image::table-page-size.png[page size]

==== *Data profiling*

Data profiling provides a summarized overview for each column in a Flat Table, taking into account chart and Report filters.
Data profiles reflect the total values of the entire table and not just the page in view.
The summary varies based on the data type of the column:

* Categorical fields: Count of distinct values.
* Numerical fields: Sum, average, minimum, and maximum values.
* Boolean fields: Sum (count of true values).
* Date fields: Minimum and maximum dates.
* Valid calculated fields will also have data profiles, and the displayed summaries depend on the data type.

By default, data profiling is turned on.
It can be turned off by checking the *Show data profile* option in the settings gear in the chart designer or the settings menu in the Report Builder.
In Explorations, the data profile setting is available in the Format panel.

[#pivot-table]
=== Pivot table

A link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pivot_table[pivot table,window=_blank] aggregates and summarizes (for example, using sum, average, count, etc.) query results and presents them in a data table.
To add a pivot table to a Report:

. On the left side of the Report editor, find the query with the data you want to display and click the *New* image:modal-add.svg[new] button under it.
. Click *Add Pivot Table* to add a new pivot table to the Report's layout.
. Add one or more fields to the quadrants on the bottom right to configure.
This can be done by dragging and dropping fields or by using the typeahead search option.
Fields should be added to the rows quadrant in the order of nesting.

==== Creating a pivot table

To create a pivot table, start by opening the New Chart menu.
You can launch the New Chart menu in two places:

. In the left sidebar of the Report editor, find the query with the data you want to work with and click the indented image:modal-add.svg[new] button under the query.
. While working on a query in the SQL editor, you can access the New Chart menu above the SQL editor.
+
image::new-chart-entry-points1.gif[creating a pivot table]
+
Once you have opened the New Chart menu, select Pivot Table.
+
image::select-ptqc1.gif[creating a pivot table]

To create a pivot table, you will need to take the following actions:

* Drop 1 or more fields to columns.
* Drop 1 or more fields to rows.
* Drop 1 or more fields to values.

image::build-ptqc1.gif[build a pivot table]

==== Format axes, columns, rows

Swap axes swaps the fields in the columns and rows in addition to swapping the axis where the measure names are displayed.

Show as column / row changes which axis the measure names are displayed on without altering the fields placed in rows and columns.

Once you have the data you care about, you can use these options to quickly finetune how it is visually represented.

image::swap-axes-and-rows-columns1.gif[swap axes and row columns in a pivot table]

==== Formatting fields

You can individually format fields in pivot tables.

image::add-formatting1.gif[Formatting Fields in a pivot table]

==== Conditional color formatting

Conditional color formatting is added to all measure values in the pivot table by default.
There are multiple ways to conditionally color format the pivot table:

* Apply color to a single field by adding fields to the color marks channel.
* Apply color to multiple measure values by adding measures to the measure values shelf and select *Add all* in the color marks channel.
The color can be removed by using the *Clear* option.
* Color can be changed by selecting the *Edit Colors* icon in the color marks channel.
The color can be added to the text instead of background by using the same affordance.
+
image::PTQC-Conditional-Color-Formatting-2023.gif[Pivot Table Conditional Color Formatting]

==== Quick calculations

xref:analyst-studio-visual-explorer.adoc#quick-calculations[Quick calculations] are available in pivot tables.

==== Adding filters

You can add xref:analyst-studio-visual-explorer.adoc#filters[filters] to pivot tables by adding fields, including xref:analyst-studio-cal-fields.adoc#overview[calculated fields], into the filters drop zone by dragging and dropping or by using the typeahead search.
You can use calculated fields in all pivot table drop zones.

image::add-filters1.gif[Adding filters]

==== Grand totals and Subtotals

You can toggle on and off either or both Column Grand totals and Subtotals and Row Grand totals and Subtotals using the Toolbar.

You will need more than one dimension and at least one measure under Columns or Rows in order to toggle on Subtotals. You can also utilize them for Visual Explorer charts.

Grand totals and Subtotals will take on the same aggregation method as the measure, for example, it will sum all the values if your measure is `SUM(field)` or it will average across all the values if your measure is `AVG(field)`.

image::grand-subtotals.gif[Grand Totals]

==== Quick sort

In the Toolbar, you have the ability to leverage our Quick Sort feature to sort your innermost discrete, categorical data by the outermost measure in either descending or ascending order.

image::sort1.gif[Quick Sort]

==== Advanced sorting

However, you also have the option to define a more granular sorting behavior.
When you can click on a field in your pivot table to open its context menu, you will see the ability to open the full xref:analyst-studio-visual-explorer.adoc#sorting[visual explorer sort] dialogue.

From there, you can specify exactly how you'd like to sort using your selected field.
We currently support four sorting methods:

. By data value.
. By field.
. By manual.
. By nested.

image::advanced-sort1.gif[Advanced sorting]

For a full breakdown of each of these options, visit our xref:analyst-studio-visual-explorer.adoc#sorting[visual explorer sorting] documentation.

////
=== (Legacy) display table

NOTE: We now no longer actively support display tables, and we will sunset them at some point in the future.

The first time you successfully execute a query, a display table containing the query's results is automatically added to your Report.
By default, data tables display all columns returned in the underlying query and each column is formatted according to the data type of each column.

Click on *Display Table* under any query in your report to control how that query's display table is formatted and sorted, and to show or hide columns:

* *Columns:* Un-check any columns on the right side to remove them from the table.
* *Sort:* Click the header of the column you'd like to sort the table by and click the *dropdown* image:action-movedown-hover.svg[drop down] button to choose how you want the table sorted.
* *Formatting:* Click on the column header for any column to see formatting options for that column on the right side of the window.
Depending on which format you choose, a number of additional customization options will appear.

'''

To manage Quick Charts in the Report, click on the three vertical dots to access the following options:

* *Duplicate*: Creates a copy of the visualization.
* *Add to builder*: Adds the visualization to the Report layout.
* *Remove from builder*: Removes the visualization from the Report layout but does not delete it from the Report.
* *Copy to {product} clipboard*: Copies the visualization that can be pasted in the same or different Report.
Read more about <<copy-visualizations-across-reports,copying and pasting visualizations>>.

=== JavaScript customization

Quick Charts can be customized using the HighCharts JavaScript API or through Alamode by turning on the JS customization setting.
This setting can be found in the Format panel of the chart editor.
This is applicable to Quick Charts created on or after October 12, 2023.
For Quick Charts created prior to this date, users will have the option to disable JS customization to access advanced chart settings available in Visual Explorer.

_Enable/disable JavaScript customization_  image:js-customization-toggle.gif[Enable/disable JavaScript customization]

Enabling JavaScript customization will result in the inability to use certain features in Quick Charts.
If a Quick Chart has any of the following features in use, the user will not be able to enable JavaScript customization for that particular visualization:

. Color by continuous fields.
. Nested or manual sorts.
. Custom table calculations.
. Display labels to modify field names in charts.
. Default field settings.
////

== Notebook visualizations

Every Report contains a built-in xref:analyst-studio-notebook.adoc[Notebook] environment where you can take the results of one or more queries, further analyze them in Python or R, and visualize the results using one of the many xref:analyst-studio-notebook.adoc#supported-libraries[built-in libraries].

////
The contents of any xref:analyst-studio-notebook.adoc#adding-cell-output-to-your-report[Notebook output cell] can be added to your Report.
These visualizations will update whenever the Notebook is run and the output changes.

== Copy visualizations across Reports

Users have the option to copy charts to the {product} clipboard and paste them under the target data source in the same or different Reports.
This can be accomplished by following the steps outlined below:

*1. Copy chart to {product} clipboard*

The copy to {product} clipboard option is accessible via the kebab menu, located on the left-hand side navigation panel within the chart designer.
Similarly, in Report View, the kebab menu provides the option to copy a visualization.
In Explorations, a copy icon is available in the top toolbar.
The following properties of the chart are copied to the {product} clipboard.

* Rows and columns
* Reference to calculated fields
* Chart title and description
* Chart filters
* All Layers (Color, Size, Text, Detail) +

*2. Paste chart from {product} clipboard*

The paste from {product} clipboard action is available in the kebab menu for each data source in the chart designer.
The paste and replace action is also available in the kebab menu for each visualization in the chart designer.
The replace action can be undone using the back button on the chart toolbar.
The fields that are required for the copied charts but are missing from the target data source will be displayed as red pills.
The user can switch out the red pills with relevant fields from the target data source.


*3. Replace fields in the pasted chart*

Users can drag fields directly on top of the field to be replaced in Visual Explorer and in Quick Chart dropzones that accept a single field.
For Quick Chart dropzones that accept more than one field, the new field can be added to the shelf and the old field can be dragged out to be removed.
The typeahead search in the dropzones can also be used to add the new fields.
Refer to the gif for more details.

Copy-pasting visualizations is helpful in the following scenarios:

* Re-creating similar charts using different data sources without having to recreate manually each time.
* Making updates to a chart in a Report in a personal collection instead of editing directly in a Report that is used by others.
* Moving charts previously created off ad-hoc queries to a reusable Dataset.
Learn more about Datasets xref:analyst-studio-datasets.adoc[here].

NOTE: If you want to copy both the chart and the associated data source, you would need to perform two separate actions. You can first add the required data source for the chart into your Report and then proceed to copy and paste the chart into your Report.

== Default field settings

Default field settings refer to the predefined configurations that are applied to the fields in a Dataset (standalone query or reusable Dataset).

* Default field settings will be applied to all applicable charts created off the Dataset in place of the system default settings (including Quick Charts and Visual Explorer charts).
* Default field settings are available for queries in a Report and when a reusable Dataset is imported into a Report.
They are not available when a reusable Dataset is created.
* Default field settings can be overridden at the visualization level.
Visualization settings will take precedence over field settings.
* Default field settings are accessible in the context menu for each field within the fields list.

The following default field settings are available:

* Formatting:
 ** Users can define default formatting for fields (short numbers, long numbers, percentages, dates, etc.) for each Dataset to avoid repeated manual configurations.
* Color settings:
 ** Users can assign specific colors to values within a field for consistent color-coding across charts using the same field.
 ** Clicking on color settings for Dimensions should open the categorical color assignment modal.
 ** Colors can be configured for fields other than the specific field for which the modal has been launched by using the field selector at the top of the modal.
 ** Selecting *Apply* or *Apply and close* in the modal will apply the chosen colors to all charts using the respective field.
 ** A continuous palette can be chosen for measures.
The selected palette will be respected only when the measure is applied to the color channel.
* Default aggregation:
 ** Users can define the aggregation desired when a field is added to a chart.
This can be overridden at the chart-level.
 ** Aggregated calculated fields will not show default aggregate options.
 ** If a default aggregate is set to a field and the underlying data type changes, that renders aggregate invalid.
We should unset previously set default and select the appropriate aggregate per the datatype.

[#faqs]
== FAQs

[discrete]
=== *Q: Is there a limit to how many visualizations can be added to a Report?*

Our recommendation is to limit the number of visualizations in a single Report to 20.
This is due to the fact that excessive visualizations can increase the loading time of the Report.
As the number of visualizations increases, more aggregation needs to be performed on the server, which can lead to slower loading times.
By limiting the number of visualizations, you can ensure that your Report loads quickly and efficiently.

=== *Q: Can you visualize a Notebook-generated visualization with {product}'s native chart editor?*

At this time, it is not possible to use our visualization tools, such as Quick Charts and Visual Explorer, to manipulate Python/R dataframes.
To visualize data from a Notebook, you will need to use a visualization library to create a visualization.
If you would like to see this functionality added in the future, please contact {support-url}, and they will be happy to add a request on your behalf for future consideration.
