You can create custom sets, which can be used to classify values in a list that you can then reuse across multiple analyses. ThoughtSpot now supports custom column sets. A column set is a custom group of values from a single column. Custom sets are community objects which remain when you navigate away from the *Search Data* page. When a set is initially created it is only available to the creator. When a set is used in an Answer or Liveboard, and the Answer or Liveboard is shared with specific users or groups of users, the set is then available for use as a community object.

NOTE: Custom column sets are in early access and off by default. To enable this feature, contact {support-url}.

To create a custom column set, first decide what type of set you want to create. For example, you can use custom column sets to define regions with specific countries included or excluded. To create a custom column set showcasing this defined list of values, follow these steps:

. Navigate to the *Search Data* page by clicking the *Search data* button in the top navigation bar.

. Click *Add* and select *Column set*.

[start=3]
. Select a *Base column* from the drop down.

. Select either *Conditions* or *Bins* under *Define groups*.
+
Conditions allow you to create groups using operators.
+
Bins allow you to create groups based on bins of specified sizes with a minimum and maximum values.

. Enter your desired parameters for the conditions or bins.
