With SQL views, you can quickly start using ThoughtSpot to get insights from your data. Simply create a connection to your external data warehouse, and you can run SQL queries against it. When you save these queries as SQL views, they become data sources that you can run traditional ThoughtSpot xref:search-data.adoc[searches] on, allowing you to create charts, tables, and Liveboards from the data.

SQL views are very similar to other ThoughtSpot views. Refer to xref:views.adoc[] for an introduction to views and their use in ThoughtSpot. This article describes a specific type of view, the SQL view, which follows the same rules as other ThoughtSpot views.

[#prerequisites]
== Prerequisites
To create a SQL view, you must satisfy the following prerequisites:

* You must have either the *Can administer ThoughtSpot* or the *Can manage data* privilege.
* If you have row-level security (RLS) requirements, apply row-level security to the view's underlying table in order to restrict the data shown when searching on the view. You cannot apply RLS directly to a view.

[#create-sql-view]
== Creating SQL views
To create a SQL view, follow these steps:

. xref:connections.adoc[Connect] to your data in your external cloud data warehouse. Note that you do not have to select any tables or columns to create the connection and start creating SQL views.

. Select *Data* from the top navigation bar.

. From the side navigation bar, select *+ Create new > Custom SQL view*.

. Choose a connection to the data you would like to query. Select *Choose connection* in the side panel, and select or search for a connection in the dropdown menu.
+
If you did not already create a connection, select *Add new connection*. Refer to the xref:connections.adoc[connections] documentation.

. After you select the connection, a list of tables appears in the side panel, under the schema and database names. To see a list of the columns in a table, select the table name. A list of the columns and their data types appears.

. In the SQL editor, write your SQL query.
+
[NOTE]
====
The SQL you use must be compliant with your data warehouse's SQL standard.

SQL views only support `SELECT` and `WITH` clauses. Your SQL view can only contain one SQL statement.
====

+
The SQL editor has autocomplete functionality, based on the tables and columns in your connection.
+
In the following example, after we type `select * from`, the SQL editor suggests several tables. When we select the `DIM_RETAPP_PRODUCTS` table, the query autocompletes as `select * from RETAILAPPAREL.PUBLIC.DIM_RETAPP_PRODUCTS AS d`, completing this part of the query and assigning the table an alias.

. Select *Run*. The results of your SQL query appear in the *Result* section. You can collapse or expand this section, by selecting the up and down arrows in the upper right of the *Results* section.

. Select *Save*.

. The *Save* modal appears, and prompts you to name your SQL view. To improve the SQL view's visibility, optionally add a description.

. Select *Save* again.

. To create a copy of the SQL view, select *Save as*.

. To return the SQL view to its last saved state, select *Revert*. This button only appears after you save the view.

. To open the SQL view you just created as a data source, select *Open view details*. Otherwise, when you finish editing the SQL view, save it and select *Exit*.

== Editing SQL views
If you have *can edit* privileges on a SQL view, you see the *Edit View* button on the details page for the view. To edit the SQL query that the view is based on, select *Edit View*.

For information about how to edit the metadata of your view, see xref:data-modeling-settings.adoc[Data modeling settings].

[#copy]
== Make a copy of a SQL view

You can create a copy of a SQL view, if you would like to make edits without changing the original SQL view.
When saving, you can type in a different name for your copy.

. Select *Data*, on the top navigation bar.
. On the views list page, select the SQL view you would like to edit a copy of.
. Open the *More* menu icon image:icon-more-10px.png[more options menu icon] and select *Make a copy*.

+
The *Make a copy* dialog appears.

. Change the name and description, as needed, and select *Save*.
+
When you navigate back to the Views page, your newly created View appears in the list.

== Managing SQL views

You can use a SQL view just like any other data source.
You can also join a SQL view to other tables or views by xref:join-add.adoc[defining a relationship].
When you save a SQL query as a view, and then use it as a source in a new search, it is similar to doing a nested query in SQL, only much easier to create.

You can perform the same actions on a SQL view that you can perform on a regular view:

* xref:share-views.adoc[Share SQL views]
* xref:join-add.adoc[Join a SQL view to another data source]
* xref:tml-sql-views.adoc[Edit, export, and import SQL views with ThoughtSpot Modeling Language]
* <<search-sql-view,Create a search based on the SQL view>>
* xref:worksheets.adoc[Create a Worksheet that includes a SQL view]

[#search-sql-view]
== Creating a search from a SQL view

After you <<create-sql-view,create a SQL view>>, you can search on it. You can do this 1 of 2 ways:

* Navigate to the SQL view you would like to search on, from the *Data* tab. Select *Search this view*. This opens the Search Data interface, where you can query your data.

* Select *Search data* from the top navigation bar. Select the *Choose sources* icon, and select your SQL view. Select *Done*. This opens the Search Data interface, where you can query your data.
