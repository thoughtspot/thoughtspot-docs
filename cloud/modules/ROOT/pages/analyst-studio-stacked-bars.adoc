== One measure

This example will walk you through how to create a simple stacked bar chart with one continuous field that’s broken down by some dimension.



1. Add a dimension to *Columns*. This discrete field will be plotted along the x-axis of your visualization, with groups formed based on the unique values within this dimension.

2. Add a continuous field to *Rows*. It will be plotted along the y-axis of your visualization, where the heights of your bars are determined by the values of that field within each x-axis group.

3. If it isn’t already, make sure to set your Mark Type to `Bar` because you want your data to be plotted as bars.

4. Add a dimension to the *Color* channel. Within each bar, you’ll see that it is now grouped by the values within this dimension. You should also now have a legend that maps each color to the corresponding series name.

== Multiple measures


This example will walk you through how to create a simple stacked bar chart when you have multiple continuous fields.


1. Add a dimension to *Columns*. This discrete field will be plotted along the x-axis of your visualization, with groups based on the unique values within this dimension.

2. Add the system-generated Measure Values to *Rows*. After you do this, you’ll see that the *Measure Values* shelf appears.

3. Add continuous fields to the *Measure Values* shelf to plot them on your visualization. These fields will be plotted along the y-axis of your visualization, where the heights of your bars are determined by the values of your columns within each x-axis group. You can think of the Measure Values field as a placeholder or variable that references the list of measures you add to the *Measure Values* shelf.

4. If it isn’t already, make sure to set your Mark Type to `Bar` because you want your data to be plotted as bars.

5. Lastly, add Measure Names to the *Color* channel. This will ensure that each field in your Measure Values shelf is now its own group within a bar. You should also now have a legend that maps each color to the corresponding field name.
