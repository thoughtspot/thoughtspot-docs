:description: SpotApps, ThoughtSpot's scriptable applications, are out-of-the-box solution templates built for specific use cases and data sources.



SpotApps are ThoughtSpot's out-of-the-box solution templates built for specific use cases and data sources, such as Snowflake Performance and Consumption, or Jira Issue Management. Starting in ThoughtSpot's 8.5.0.cl release, SpotApps do *_not_* refer to any set of multiple TML files. To learn about migrating custom sets of TML files, refer to xref:tml-import-export-multiple.adoc[Migrate multiple TML files].

SpotApps are built on xref:tml.adoc[ThoughtSpot Modeling Language (TML)] Blocks, which are pre-built pieces of code that are easy to download and implement directly from the product.

SpotApps use xref:scriptability.adoc[Scriptability], ThoughtSpot's solution for migrating data models (worksheets, tables, and views) and content (Liveboards and answers) between different environments, such as development and production. You can optionally edit these ThoughtSpot objects during the migration process.
