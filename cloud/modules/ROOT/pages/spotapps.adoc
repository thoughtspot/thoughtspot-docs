:description: SpotApps, ThoughtSpot's scriptable applications, are out-of-the-box solution templates built for specific use cases and data sources.



SpotApps are ThoughtSpot's out-of-the-box solution templates built for specific use cases and data sources, such as Snowflake Performance and Consumption, or Jira Issue Management. Starting in ThoughtSpot's 8.5.0.cl release, SpotApps do *_not_* refer to any set of multiple TML files. To learn about migrating custom sets of TML files, refer to xref:tml-import-export-multiple.adoc[Migrate multiple TML files].

SpotApps are built on xref:tml.adoc[ThoughtSpot Modeling Language (TML)] Blocks, which are pre-built pieces of code that are easy to download and implement directly from the product.

SpotApps use ThoughtSpot's solution for xref:scriptability.adoc[migrating data models (Worksheets, tables, and views) and content (Liveboards and Answers)] between different environments, such as development and production. You can optionally edit these ThoughtSpot objects during the migration process.

== Available SpotApps and Blocks
ThoughtSpot currently supports the following SpotApps, built on Analytics Blocks. Analytics Blocks can include pre-built Worksheet, Answer, and Liveboard Blocks, based on your application data in your cloud data warehouse.

SpotApps are built specifically for their application's out-of-the-box data model. To deploy a SpotApp successfully, you must ensure the data exists in your cloud data warehouse according to the required schema. Customizations can be handled with manual edits during the deployment and mapping process. For more information, refer to xref:spotapps-deploy.adoc[Deploying SpotApps].

[#prerequisites]
== Prerequisites to deploy SpotApps
To deploy any SpotApp, you must:

* Review the required tables and columns for the SpotApp. For example, the Jira Sprint Management SpotApp requires the following tables and columns, which you can see in the xref:spotapps-jira-sprint.adoc#schema[Jira Sprint Management SpotApp] article:
+
|===
| Table |Column | Column type | Required column

| JIRA_SPRINTS| ID| NUMBER| Yes
| JIRA_SPRINTS| NAME| VARCHAR | Yes
| JIRA_SPRINTS| STATE | VARCHAR | Yes
| JIRA_SPRINTS| STARTDATE | TIMESTAMP | Yes
| JIRA_SPRINTS| ENDDATE | TIMESTAMP | Yes
| JIRA_SPRINTS| COMPLETEDATE| TIMESTAMP | Yes
|===
* Ensure that your columns match the required column type listed in the schema for your SpotApp.
* Sync all tables and columns from the application the SpotApp uses (for example, Jira or Hubspot) to your cloud data warehouse. You can sync only the required tables and columns, but ThoughtSpot recommends syncing all tables and columns from the application to your CDW. The columns can be the application's out-of-the-box columns, or any custom columns that you are using instead of the out-of-the-box columns.
+
NOTE: If you are using an ETL/ELT tool or working with another team in your organization to move data, our recommendation is that you sync *_all_* columns from the tables listed in the SpotApp.
* Ensure that you have completed the SpotApp-specific prerequisites. For example, for the Jira Sprint Management SpotApp, you must also run several SQL commands before deploying the SpotApp. Refer to the individual SpotApp articles to view individual prerequisites. For example, here are the xref:spotapps-jira-sprint.adoc#prerequisites[Jira Sprint Management SpotApp prerequisites].
* Obtain credentials and *SYSADMIN* privileges to connect to your cloud data warehouse. The cloud data warehouse must contain the data you would like ThoughtSpot to use to create Answers, Liveboards, and Worksheets. Refer to the connection reference for your cloud data warehouse for information about required credentials:
