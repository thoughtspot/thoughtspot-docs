** Category (Number, Percentage, Currency)

[#back-button]
== Undo, redo, and reset buttons
As you work with charts and chart configuration, you may want to undo or redo an action. Use the in-product undo, redo, and reset buttons to reset or go back or forward 1 step each time you make a change in a search or saved Answer (for example, when you add a new column to the search, drill down, or sort). These buttons appear to the right of the search bar in a search or saved Answer. Note that the reset button is only available for saved Answers; it resets the Answer to its last saved state.

If you do not have the xref:answer-experience-new.adoc[new Answer experience] on, you can use the browser back button. The browser back button is not as precise, and does not work on saved Answers.
