If you want a column to be part of your search and show up in the table view, but you do not want to include it in your chart, you can drag it to the '`Not Visualized`' section. You can also use this functionality to perform a hidden sort, by moving the measure column you want to sort by to the '`Not Visualized`' section.

== Undo, redo, and reset buttons
As you work with charts and chart configuration, you may want to undo or redo an action. Use the in-product undo, redo, and reset buttons to reset or go back or forward 1 step each time you make a change in a search or saved answer (for example, when you add a new column to the search, drill down, or sort). These buttons appear to the right of the search bar in a search or saved answer. Note that the reset button is only available for saved answers; it resets the answer to its last saved state.

If you do not have the xref:answer-experience-new.adoc[new answer experience] on, you can use the browser back button. The browser back button is not as precise, and does not work on saved answers.
