== One value

This example will walk you through how to create a simple pivot table when you’re breaking down one value across multiple dimensions.

1. Add discrete fields to either *Rows* or *Columns*. These are the groups that you want to aggregate your value by. You can have as many groups as you’d like.

2. Add a continuous, aggregated field to the *Text* channel.

== Multiple values

This example will walk you through how to create a simple pivot table when you’re breaking down multiple values across multiple dimensions.

1. Add discrete fields to either *Rows* or *Columns*. These are the groups that you want to aggregate your value by. You can have as many groups as you’d like.

2. Add the system-generated Measure Values to the *Text* channel. After you do this, you’ll see that the *Measure Values* shelf appears.

3. Now you can add as many continuous, aggregated values as you’d like in the *Measure Values* shelf.

4. Lastly, add Measure Names to either *Rows* or *Columns*. Each cell currently only supports one mark, so by default the values are drawn on top of each other; adding Measure Names will ensure that each field in your *Measure Values* shelf is now its own group.
