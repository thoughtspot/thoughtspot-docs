The line stacked column chart is similar to the line column chart, except that it divides its columns with an attribute in the legend. The line stacked column chart combines xref:chart-column-stacked.adoc[stacked column] and xref:chart-line.adoc[line] charts.
There are two y-axes, one for each measure.

You can enable shared y-axes for the two measures. To enable shared y-axes, select the dropdown menu icon image:icon-caret-right-20px.png[Dropdown menu icon image] next to one of the y-axis labels, choose *Group*, and select the unchecked measure.
