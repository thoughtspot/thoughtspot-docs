Use the auto-answer creation feature to experiment with creating an answer from a search.

To simplify data modeling, ThoughtSpot supports automated answer creation during Setup, allowing you to create and save Search visualizations for future use.
When creating answers through Setup, you can view suggested answers for the measures, attributes and dates you select, and make changes to the auto-created answers before you save them.
