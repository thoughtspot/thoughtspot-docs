:description: CSV upload for Snowflake is configured for each connection individually.
:jira: SCAL-192732

CSV upload for Snowflake is configured for each connection individually. Before configuring it, you must have a pre-defined schema and database in Snowflake. When uploaded, the data goes to memory and is then pushed to Snowflake. No uploaded CSV data is stored in ThoughtSpot.

NOTE: To enable CSV upload for Snowflake for your cluster, contact {support-url}. Once this feature is enabled, your administrator can configure CSV upload for each Snowflake connection.
