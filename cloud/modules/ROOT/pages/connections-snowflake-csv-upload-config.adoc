CSV upload for Snowflake is configured for each connection individually. Before configuring it, you must have a pre-defined schema and database in Snowflake. When uploaded, the data goes to memory and is then pushed to Snowflake. No uploaded CSV data is stored in ThoughtSpot.

. Select *Data* in the top navigation bar.
