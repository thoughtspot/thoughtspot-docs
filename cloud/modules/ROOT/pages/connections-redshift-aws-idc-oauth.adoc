ThoughtSpot supports AWS IDC OAuth for a {connection} connection. Depending on the identity provider, you need to complete different steps to configure the integration. This is a high-level overview. We recommend following the AWS documentation for how to configure AWS or the link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/redshift-iam-access-control-native-idp.html[IDP^]. See: link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/redshift-iam-access-control-idp-connect.html[Connect Redshift with IAM Identity Center to give users a single sign-on experience^].

[#part-1]
== Prerequisites

To set up OAuth for {connection}, you must have the following:

* An AWS account.
* An Amazon Redshift cluster.

== Configure the IdP

Refer to the link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/tutorials.html[AWS documentation^].

Note that your redirect URL will be in the format: `https://<your_instance_name>/callosum/v1/connection/generateTokens`.

== Set up OAuth

The OAuth application is used to authenticate the user and provide a login token.

Follow the steps in the link:https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/integrate-identity-provideridp-with-amazon-redshift-query-editor-v2-using-aws-iam-identity-center-for-seamless-single-sign-on/[AWS documentation^].

== Connect to Redshift

Refer to xref:connections-redshift-add.adoc[Create a Redshift connection].

== Okta

See link:https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/integrate-identity-provideridp-with-amazon-redshift-query-editor-v2-using-aws-iam-identity-center-for-seamless-single-sign-on/[Integrate Identity Provider with Amazon Query Editor V2 using AWS IAM Identity Center for Seamless Sign-on^].


== OAuth connection improvements

If you do not have a valid OAuth access token, you can now directly navigate to the OAuth authorization screen when performing one of the following actions on a connection shared with you:

** View sample data
** Create a custom SQL view
** Edit the connection
