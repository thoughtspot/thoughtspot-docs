You can now ask questions to Spotter right within Microsoft Teams. Begin a direct message or use a channel to ask questions on your data sources in natural language. ThoughtSpot responds in chart format.

Note that Spotter in Microsoft Teams is currently not available for TSE, GCP clusters, and in the EU region.




NOTE: ThoughtSpot for MS Teams is in beta and off by default. To enable this feature, contact {support-url}.


== Features of Spotter


=== Answering data questions


Users can ask data questions by entering queries in a natural language format.


* This functionality requires adding Spotter to a *channel* or using *direct message*, and selecting a Model.


* Note: Spotter will only work if the end user has *Can download data* and *Can use Sage* privileges.


* For example, typing `Show me the top 10 products for this quarter` will prompt the bot to process the query and return results in a visual format (provided the appropriate data set is selected).


This feature enables users to access data insights directly from Microsoft Teams, streamlining workflows without switching applications.




== Set up Spotter for Microsoft Teams


To set up ThoughtSpot for Microsoft Teams, follow these steps:


. Navigate to ThoughtSpot and open your user profile by clicking the user icon and selecting *Profile*.

You can now get answers to your data questions without leaving Microsoft Teams. Simply add Spotter to a channel and ask your question in natural language. The answer appears as a visualization.


== Begin interacting with Spotter


After connecting to Spotter for Microsoft Teams:


. You see a direct message with Spotter.
. Spotter prompts you to first choose a Model to search on.

NOTE: If you click *View prompts* above the chat entry bar, you can see a list of all Spotter commands in Microsoft Teams: Help, Show Models, Show Columns, and Reset.
. To view your Models, type "Show Models" and hit return, or click the *Show Models* button. A list of Models appears.


. Click the *Select* button next to the Model you want to select to the channel, then begin your search by typing questions.


. If you want to see what columns are included in the Model, type "Show Columns" or click the *Show Columns* button.

Columns appear, separated into attributes, measures, and date columns.


. Follow-up questions can be asked, with the bot maintaining context for coherent responses. To begin a new search without the previous context, type "Reset" or hit the *Reset* button.

Spotter can now be used within Microsoft Teams channels, enabling collaborative and contextual conversations around data.


To invite Spotter into a Teams channel:

. Click *Spotter* to open the bot install dialog.


. Select the channel, then click *Add* to complete installation.


. You’ll see a confirmation: "Spotter has been added to this channel."

Alternatively, you can also:

* Reset: To begin a new context, type `@Spotter reset`.


IMPORTANT: Channel commands such as *show models* and *show columns* must be posted directly in the main channel (not as replies).




== Automatic disconnection


Please note that Microsoft Teams may occasionally get disconnected automatically due to various reasons, such as token expiration or network issues. In such cases, you will need to reconnect to restore functionality.

You can disconnect from Microsoft Teams at any time by going to your user profile in ThoughtSpot and clicking *Disconnect from MS Teams*.
