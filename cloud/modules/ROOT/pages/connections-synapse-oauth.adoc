:description: ThoughtSpot supports OAuth for a Microsoft Azure Synapse connection.

ThoughtSpot supports OAuth for a Microsoft Azure {connection} connection. This page describes the setup and configuration required for using OAuth2.0 with Azure AD as the IdP for Azure {connection} connections.

[#part-1]
== Part 1: Create AD application in Azure

The first step in setting up OAuth with Azure AD as an IdP is to create an active directory application in Azure.

. Sign in to the Azure portal and navigate to “Azure Active Directory” resource.
. Under *Manage* in the side navigation bar, select **App registrations** and then **New registration**.
+

+
The *Register an application* modal appears.
+

. Enter a name for the application, and select the supported account types.

. For the Redirect URI, enter your ThoughtSpot instance’s hostname in the following format: `\https://<your_instance_name>/callosum/v1/connection/generateTokens`, and select **Register**.
+
For example: `\https://myTS.com/callosum/v1/connection/generateTokens`.
+
The OAuth client application creation is complete.
+
The following image displays example details of an application.
+

. Make a note of the **Application (client) ID**, which you will use later in the OAuth2.0 authorization workflow.
+
You will now create the client secret for your application.

. In the application you just created, select **Certificates & Secrets**.
+

. Select **New client secret** to create a secret for the application. This secret will also be used in OAuth2.0 authorization flow along with client ID.

. Under **API / Permissions name**, for Azure SQL Database, add the **user_impersonation** permission, as shown in the following image.
+
The *Delegated* type indicates that the application will authenticate on behalf of the user.
+

. From the application home page, select **Endpoints** and make a note of the OAuth2.0 authorization and token endpoints.

== Part 2: Set active directory admin for database server

An active directory user must be set as Admin for the SQL server.

. Navigate to the SQL server associated with the {connection} deployment and select **Active Directory Admin**.
+

. At the top of the page, click **Set admin** to search for users in the directory, and select the user you want to set as administrator for the server.
+
image::azure-ad-2.png[Click Set admin]
+
You should now see the **Admin name** set for the server.
+
Active directory is now linked  with the SQL database.

== Part 3: Create database user

. Create the AD user you want to use for database login by logging into the database with the administrator user you set earlier.

. Use the following DDL in the following format to create the user:
+
`CREATE USER [<email_address@company>] FROM EXTERNAL PROVIDER;`
+
**Example**:
+
`CREATE USER [admin@example.com] FROM EXTERNAL PROVIDER;`
+
This is referred to as a “contained user” created in the database mapped to Azure AD identity. For details, see Microsoft's documentation:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/database/authentication-aad-configure?tabs=azure-powershell#create-contained-users-mapped-to-azure-ad-identities[Create contained users mapped to Azure AD identities^].
+
You cannot manage database roles for AD users from Azure. You must manage them from the database side.

== Troubleshooting

If the following `Invalid Resource` error appears on initial login, you must update the API permissions.

Under **API / Permissions name**, for Azure SQL Database, add the **user_impersonation** permission, as shown in the following image.

The *Delegated* type indicates that the application will authenticate on behalf of the user.
