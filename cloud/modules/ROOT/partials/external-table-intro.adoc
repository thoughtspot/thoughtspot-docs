ThoughtSpot supports querying external tables stored in external data stores, such as Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage, via your cloud data warehouse. These external tables can be in formats such as text, parquet, avro, or json, depending on the formats your cloud data warehouse supports.

After you create the external tables in your {connection} environment and connect to {connection} in ThoughtSpot, you can query them like any other table in your connection. You can also join them to other tables in the connection, as long as they belong to the same connection. External tables in ThoughtSpot behave in the same way that regular tables from your connection do. However, note that there may be performance implications when querying the external tables, since you do not store them in the cloud data warehouse.

This option is available for Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery, and Snowflake.
