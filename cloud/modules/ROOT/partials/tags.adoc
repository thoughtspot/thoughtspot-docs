You can create tags to make it easier for people to find data sources and Liveboards. Tags are global in scope. This means that everyone can see the tags and use them to tag objects. They can also filter lists of objects by tag. Tags are often used to designate subject areas, such as sales, HR, and finance, but you can use them any way you like.

Keep in mind these permissions when working with tags:

- Only administrators can create tags.
- Anyone can apply a tag.
- Anyone can filter by a tag.
- Free Trial and Team Edition users do not have access to tags functionality.
