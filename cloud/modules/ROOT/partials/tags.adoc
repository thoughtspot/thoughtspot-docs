You can create tags to make it easier for people to find data sources and Liveboards. Tags are global in scope. This means that everyone can see the tags and use them to tag objects. They can also filter lists of objects by tag. Tags are often used to designate subject areas, such as sales, HR, and finance, but you can use them any way you like.

Keep in mind these permissions when working with tags:

- Only administrators can create tags.
- Anyone can apply a tag.
- Anyone can filter by a tag.
- You can only filter by one tag at a time from the UI.

[#filter-by-tags]
== Filter by tags

Whenever you are selecting objects from a list, you can filter by tag to find what you’re looking for. Anyone can use tags to filter lists of Liveboards or data sources. You can also filter by a tag when selecting data sources.

Note that you can only filter by one tag at a time in the UI. To get a list of ThoughtSpot objects or object headers that is filtered by multiple tag, use the https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/?pageid=metadata-api[Metadata API]. The `list` and `listobjectheaders` endpoints allow you to filter by multiple tags.

To filter by tag:

. From the top menu, choose *Answers*, *Liveboards*, or *Data*.

. Click *Select tag*, and select the name of the tag you want to filter by. +
