ThoughtSpot's color palette is in the following format. ThoughtSpot assumes that any custom color palettes are in a similar format.

*Standard color palette*

| Primary 1 (P1) | Primary 2 (P2) | Primary 3 (P3) | Primary 4 (P4) | Primary 5 (P5) | Primary 6 (P6) | Primary 7 (P7) | Primary 8 (P8)

| Lightest 1 (L1) | Lightest 2 (L2) | Lightest 3 (L3) | Lightest 4 (L4) | Lightest 5 (L5) | Lightest 6 (L6) | Lightest 7 (L7) | Lightest 8 (L8)

*Standard color algorithm*

The standard rules for color application for charts are as follows:

* If the chart requires only one color, ThoughtSpot selects a primary color depending on <<color-rotation-option,whether you enabled color rotation>>.

* ThoughtSpot selects the number of primary colors based on the total number of colors required. These colors always appear in order: Primary 1 appears first, then Primary 3, and so on. See <<primary-color-count,Primary color count selection>>.

* If the chart requires more than one color, ThoughtSpot determines the number of shades of each color by dividing the total number of colors by the number of primary colors. For example, if the chart requires 20 colors, ThoughtSpot uses 6 primary colors. 20/6 = 3 shades of each color. ThoughtSpot picks the remaining two shades from the first two primary colors.

* Depending on the number of shades required, ThoughtSpot uses the following shades of each color, in sequence:
+
|===
| Number of shades | Default mode | <<rainbow-mode,Rainbow mode>>

| 1 | Primary | Primary
| 2 | Primary, Lightest | Primary, Light
| 3 | Primary, Lightest, Dark | Primary, Light, Dark
| 4 | Primary, Lightest, Dark, Light | Primary, Lightest, Dark, Light
| 5 | Primary, Lightest, Dark, Light, Darkest | Primary, Lightest, Dark, Light, Darkest

[#primary-color-count]
*Primary color count selection*

The number of primary colors a chart uses depends on the number of total colors the chart requires. Refer to the following table:

|===
| Number of colors required | Number of primary colors used

| 1 | 1
| 2-8 | 4
| 9-15 | 5
| 16-24 | 6
| 25-35 | 7
| 36+ | 8

|===

[#color-rotation-option]
*Color rotation*

The Style Customization xref:style-customization.adoc#color-rotation[Color Rotation] option determines whether single-color charts use a random primary color or always use the first primary color in the palette. If you enable Color Rotation, ThoughtSpot may choose any color from Primary 1 through Primary 6 in your color palette for single-color charts. If you disable Color Rotation, ThoughtSpot always chooses Primary 1.

[#rainbow-mode]
*Rainbow mode*

Some chart types use *rainbow mode* to allocate colors instead of the default allocation. The default allocation uses all shades of a color first and then applies all shades of the next color required. *Rainbow mode* uses all the primary colors in your color palette, then one shade of each primary color, then the next shade of each primary color, and so on.

*Chart-specific color algorithms*

For information on how colors work for specific charts, refer to the following table.

|===
| Chart type | Color algorithm | Mode | Notes

| Column | Standard | Default | N/A
| Stacked Column | Standard | Default | N/A
| Line | Standard | Rainbow | N/A
| KPI | Standard | Rainbow | Cannot currently select colors manually. As a workaround, select a color in a different chart type, and switch back to KPI.
| Pivot Table | N/A | N/A | If in heatmap mode, follows heatmap logic.
| Pie | Standard | Default | N/A
| Bar | Standard | Default | N/A
| Stacked Bar | Standard | Default | N/A
| Line Column | Standard | Default | N/A
| Area | Standard | Default | N/A
| Stacked Area | Standard | Default | N/A
| Line Stacked Column | Standard | Default | The line counts as another color. ThoughtSpot applies color to the line before applying color to the columns.
| Scatter | Standard | Default | ThoughtSpot chooses colors for points based on the order of the points in the data response.
| Bubble | Standard | Rainbow | Bubble charts use translucent versions of the standard color palette.
| Waterfall | Standard | Rainbow | N/A
| Heatmap | Uses a color range based on Primary 2 | Default | N/A
| Treemap | Uses a color range based on Primary 1 | Default | N/A
| Funnel | Standard | Default | N/A
| Geo Bubble | Standard | Default | Bubbles are translucent and appear lighter than the selected color.
| Geo Heatmap | Uses a specific lilac. | Default | No overrides are available currently.
| Geo Area | Uses a specific yellow-to-red gradient. You can select an individual color to use, and ThoughtSpot builds a gradient around that color. | N/A | N/A
| Sankey | Standard | Default | Cannot override the colors used. ThoughtSpot chooses colors for points based on the order of the points in the data response.
| Radar | ThoughtSpot sets the base color by default. The color of the radar line is determined by the standard algorithm. | Default | N/A
| Candlestick | Up/down default to green/red respectively. You can override them manually. | N/A | N/A
| Pareto | Standard | Default | The cumulative line is the first color. The active measure is the second color.
