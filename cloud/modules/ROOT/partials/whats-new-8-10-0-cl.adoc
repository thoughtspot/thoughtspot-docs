=== Schedule ThoughtSpot Sync

// Naomi

ThoughtSpot Sync schedules are now GA and on by default. When creating a sync from ThoughtSpot to an external business app (Google Sheets, Microsoft Teams, Slack), you can now schedule the sync to repeat on an hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly basis. To try it out, create a sync and select *Schedule your sync*.

=== ThoughtSpot Sync Salesforce connection

// Naomi

ThoughtSpot Sync for Salesforce is now GA and on by default. You can now sync data directly from an Answer or custom SQL view to Salesforce. Using ThoughtSpot Sync, you can push insights directly to Salesforce, notify your teams, and view data in context. ThoughtSpot Sync automatically establishes a secure pipeline to the destination app and thus eliminates the need for building custom connectors.

[#8-10-0-cl-delete-tables]
[discrete]
=== Delete tables from ThoughtSpot

// Naomi

Previously, when deleting tables from Connections, ThoughtSpot did not delete the table’s metadata completely. Starting in 8.10.0.cl, tables deleted through the ThoughtSpot UI disappear completely from your cluster.

// Falcon tables used to be deleted using multiple APIs. Now you can use metadata/delete API to delete any tables from the UI, and table IDs will be deleted simultaneously. Possibly already documented in Developer 8.10.0.cl docs.

// don't need to mention the api if it's not involved in the process. don't mention falcon in cloud -- what tables does this apply to if you're a cloud customer? What was happening before and what is happening now?
