****

In this release we introduce a unified help and support experience in ThoughtSpot.

To open help and support, click the question mark icon image:icon-question-mark-light.png[Question Mark icon].

Just like the original information center, you can access *Help*, *Getting started*, and *What's new*. Now, you can also access support, and see the version of ThoughtSpot that you are currently using. The original support icon which appeared in the bottom right corner of ThoughtSpot has been removed.

In addition to these features, your ThoughtSpot administrator can add custom links, which appear under the *Contact support* menu item.

NOTE: We are gradually making this available to customers, so if you don't see it immediately after your instance is upgraded, it should appear within one month.

=== Chat support changes

With support, you can still send a message, book a call with a product specialist, or search for answers in our documentation, training, and community sites, using the help and support menu to open the support window.
ifdef::free-trial-feature[]
You now also have the option of sharing a recording of your screen (without audio) if requested by a support agent, which can help them identify and resolve your issue more quickly.
endif::free-trial-feature[]


NOTE: If you currently have your in-product support feature disabled, the *Contact support* menu option will display *Report a problem* instead.

[#10-7-0-cl-parameter]

=== Parameters in column names in charts and tables

You can now add a parameter as a variable in the x and y-axis labels and column names of an Answer. When you select a different parameter value in the Answer, previously only the data changed. Now contextual information (such as axis name, column header, and legends) also updates to reflect parameter selected. Any place a parameter is used in Liveboards or Answers automatically displays the current information associated with the selected parameter value. For example, if you have a parameter which contains three possible values (Price, Shipping Cost, and Quantity), when you select Price, the information about the price of items is displayed. When you select Shipping Cost, the information updates to show shipping-related information, and so on.

[#10-8-0-cl-measure-names-and-values]
[discrete]
=== Blended axes in pivot table charts

In this release, we introduce a new way of adding multiple measures to pivot table charts called blended axes. With blended axes, you can group measures and control them through a system-defined chip called *Values* in the chart configuration settings. This chip acts like an attribute, with the different measures as its unique values. You can also place measures in rows of pivot tables instead of columns. This makes it possible to have more combinations and configurations of charts, including slicing the color for different measures, comparing multiple measures together, and more customizable pivot configurations.

You can now set KPI alerts to trigger when a selected attribute changes. This can include changes in the value of the attribute, such as an increase in sales by percentage by state, or a scheduled alert to trigger on a weekly basis.

For example, if you wanted to create an alert for a KPI tracking sales of different phones by brand, you could choose the intended brands as attributes and set an alert to be notified when sales for those specific brands dropped by 5%. To enable this feature, contact your administrator.

=== Org context for sharing links
Org-specific URLs are now available to all users and on by default. URLs in emails now include Org context so that users are taken directly to the correct Liveboard in the correct Org even if they belong to multiple Orgs. You can also move between different browser tabs that point to different Orgs.
