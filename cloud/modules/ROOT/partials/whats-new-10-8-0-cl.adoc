You can now use Spotter to conversationally search your data in Slack. Follow-up questions remain within the same thread, preserving context. Pin a Worksheet or Model to a channel to ensure quick access to data from that Worksheet or Model. Spotter in Slack replaces the ThoughtSpot app in Slack. To enable this feature, contact your administrator.

NOTE: Spotter in Slack is not available for GCP and ThoughtSpot Embedded clusters yet.

You can now give feedback on AI-generated Answers in Spotter without interrupting your searching conversation. When marking an Answer incorrect, you can now edit the underlying search, save, and review the search query tokens making up the Answer. If you mark an Answer correct, you can review and save the underlying search query tokens so Spotter remembers your choices in the future for similar questions.

Now, Spotter’s capabilities have expanded to include natural language responses, allowing Spotter to gather information about your business questions before translating answers into visualizations.

You can ask Spotter to suggest questions during the conversation.
Spotter can also answer 'why' questions.
Spotter can now take in broad topical questions, break them into smaller questions, and then generate multiple answers to answer your question.

ThoughtSpot introduces Analyst Studio, where you can write SQL queries to create reusable Datasets. You can set schedules to refresh Datasets, or publish them to the Data Workspace, where you can join multiple Datasets to query as a whole.
ThoughtSpot's enhanced identity and access management (IAMv2) allows users with the *Can manage/access analyst studio* privilege to navigate to Analyst Studio seamlessly from the Data workspace.

=== Query set groups [.badge.badge-early-access-whats-new]#Early Access#
endif::[]
ThoughtSpot users can now define groups for included query values using conditions in query sets. Conditions allow you to create groups using operators, to specify the parameters of the group.

For example, you could create a query set that list each customer, their sales dollar amount, and then add a formula that ranks the amount in descending order. You could then add groups to define Gold, Silver, and Bronze levels where Gold is ranked 1-10, Silver 11-50, and Bronze every other value.

=== Custom sets [.badge.badge-early-access-whats-new]#Early Access#
endif::[]

You can create custom sets, which can be used to classify values in a list that you can then reuse across multiple analyses. A column set is a custom group of values from a single column. For example, you can use custom sets to define regions with specific countries included or excluded. Custom sets are community objects which remain when you navigate away from the Search Data page and can be used by any user with view access to the underlying Worksheet. To enable this feature, contact {support-url}.

If you have edit privileges to Worksheets or Models, you can now create column name aliases, linked to the system language you selected in your user profile. This allows you to search for column names in your system language, instead of typing the columns in English and the keywords in your system language. You can also set column descriptions in other languages to be displayed according to the locale you choose.
