The first person on the account must complete a series of steps to enable others to use ThoughtSpot with your organization's data. See xref:8.0.0.cl@cloud:ROOT:ts-cloud-getting-started.adoc[Getting Started with ThoughtSpot Cloud].

**New Answer experience**

The xref:8.0.0.cl@cloud:ROOT:answer-experience-new.adoc[new answer experience] is on by default, and offers these features:

+
Along with the new features, we are deprecating the following affordances that were in the earlier versions of the product:

- *Browser back button*; instead, use the new in-product back button to the right of the search bar in a search or saved answer.
- *Multiple join path resolution* within the formula editor or a search; instead, the system now prompts you to resolve this issue and avoid confusion or incorrect data by creating a Worksheet with the correct join path.
- *Send feedback* from the *More (...)* menu on an Answer or search
- *Client-side summaries for tables*; instead, use headline summaries, which are integrated with the table columns. You can pin them to Liveboards.

**Liveboard schedule**

The new *Schedule* feature combines the Liveboard follow and xref:8.0.0.cl@cloud:ROOT:liveboard-schedule.adoc[Liveboard Schedule] into a single action. Select the *Schedule* button to the left of the *More (...)* menu for a new schedule to receive emails with a pdf representation of your Liveboard.

Liveboard schedules that your team created in earlier releases of our product appear in the list of Liveboard schedules as _Migrated from follow (your display name)_.

**Search answers**

Navigate to the *Search answers and Liveboards* page from the top navigation bar; see xref:8.0.0.cl@cloud:ROOT:search-answers.adoc#search-answers-navigate[Search answers].
