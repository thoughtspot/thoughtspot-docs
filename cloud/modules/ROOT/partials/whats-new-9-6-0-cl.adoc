When running change analysis, you can now see additional insights. For example, ThoughtSpot will detect values that underwent the highest percentage change between the two data points defined in your analysis, and values whose share of the total changed the most. The additional insights appear below the main analysis in the change analysis pop-up window.

// NOTE: Additional insights are only available for Sum and Count aggregates.

You can now see the state of query execution for any Liveboard visualization while it loads. If a visualization takes longer than three seconds to load, ThoughtSpot displays the current query execution status (executing query, waiting for connection, or processing query) to help users identify the reason for the delay.

=== Index Statistics Liveboard

// Naomi

Admin users can now see indexing statistics for their cluster using the Index Statistics Liveboard. You can filter the results by connection, table, and column, and see the breakdown of indexed search tokens in the visualizations. This Liveboard helps you see how many search tokens you are using, and can help you diagnose indexing issues and errors. To try it out, go to *Liveboards* and search for *Index statistics*.

=== dbt sync

In the past, ThoughtSpot generated a new Worksheet every time a user edited an existing dbt data model. Now, ThoughtSpot maintains a persistent connection with dbt and provides realtime updates. Users can update an object, update an object and create a new object, or simply create a new object.

=== dbt Worksheet join rule

Previously, when a Worksheet was created from a dbt model, the default worksheet join rule was "apply all joins". Now, "apply joins progressively" is the default. This means that when you search on a Worksheet, joins are applied as each search term is added, rather than applying all joins to every search.
