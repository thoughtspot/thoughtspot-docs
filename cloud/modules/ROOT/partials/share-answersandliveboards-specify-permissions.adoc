NOTE: If a hidden column is used in an Answer pinned to a Liveboard, then the entire Liveboard becomes read-only to users. This limits Liveboard functionality, which means the ability to adjust filters and download data is restricted.
. If the selected group or user does not have access to the underlying data, you must enable access to the Worksheet, view, or table.
A black warning symbol appears when you try to share with a user who does not have underlying data access.
If you select it, it tells you to enable access:

+
To enable access, select *Give view access to underlying data sources* at the bottom of the dialog.
You can select the arrow to view the data sources.

Simply select the *Copy link* button at the bottom of the sharing dialog.
