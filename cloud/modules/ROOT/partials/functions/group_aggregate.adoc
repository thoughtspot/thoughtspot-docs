[#group_aggregate]
group_aggregate::
  Takes a measure and optional attributes and filters. Used
to aggregate measures with different granularities and filters than the columns used in the search. Commonly used in comparison analysis.
+
This formula takes the following form:
+
----
group_aggregate (
  <aggregation(measure)>,
  <groupings>,
  <filters>)
----
+
NOTE: Define lists using curly brackets, `{ }`. Optional list functions `query_groups` or `query_filters` specify the lists or filters used in the original search. Use `+` (plus) and `-` (minus) to add or exclude specific columns for query groups. See xref:formulas-aggregation-flexible.adoc[Flexible aggregation functions].
