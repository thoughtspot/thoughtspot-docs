. Click the delete icon to the right of the join name.
The *Confirm delete* window appears.

If the join has dependents, a different window appears, warning you that deleting this join makes the dependent objects stop working until you recreate the join later. However, ThoughtSpot does not delete the dependent objects. You can use this functionality to xref:relationship-delete.adoc#change-cardinality[reverse the join cardinality] or otherwise edit a join without deleting its dependents.
. Click *Delete*.
