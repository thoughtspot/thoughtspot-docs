To delete a join:

. Select *Data* in the top menu.
. Find the origin table, Model or view of the join you want to delete through browsing, Search, or selecting the appropriate Tag(s).
. Select the name of your origin table, Model or view in the list.
. Select the *Joins* tab.
The list of existing joins from the table, Model, or view appears.
+
NOTE: If you want to delete an external join from a Model, you must click *Joins within this Model* under the *Joins* tab and select *Joins from this Model*.

. Select the delete icon to the right of the join name.
The *Confirm delete* window appears.
+
If the join has dependents, a different window appears, warning you that deleting this join makes the dependent objects stop working until you recreate the join later. However, ThoughtSpot does not delete the dependent objects.
//You can use this functionality to xref:relationship-delete.adoc#change-cardinality[reverse the join cardinality] or otherwise edit a join without deleting its dependents.
. Select *Delete*.
