[#chart-kpi-sparkline]
**Sparkline visualization for KPI charts**

With this release, we are announcing the Sparkline chart enhancement for the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) chart. Just search for a metric using time keywords, like `Sales weekly', and create sparkline visuals of your dataâ€™s KPI.  See xref:chart-kpi.adoc#kpi-sparkline[Sparkline visualizations for time-series KPIs].

**Reset saved answers**

Have you ever tried different chart types and filtering conditions on an answer, and then decided you wanted to set your answer back to its original state? Now you can easily do that by using the new *reset* button, next to the *undo* and *redo* buttons. This is only available for saved answers in the xref:answer-experience-new.adoc[new answer experience].
