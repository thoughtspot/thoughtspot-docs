[#9-1-0-cl-mandatory-filters]
[discrete]
=== Mandatory Liveboard filters

Mandatory Liveboard filters are now GA. Mark certain filters in your Liveboard as mandatory. If you add mandatory filters to a Liveboard, the visualizations will only load after Liveboard viewers select values for the mandatory filters. Use mandatory filters for Liveboards that contain data that may not be relevant for everyone who must view and consume the Liveboard. Mandatory filters also lower query and performance costs. To try the feature out, select *Mandatory filter* when adding a filter to a Liveboard. For more information about mandatory filters, see
ifndef::pendo-links[]

When scheduling a sync with an external app, you can now choose to schedule every 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, and 45 minutes, in addition to the other existing schedule options.

[#9-1-0-cl-kpi-explain-change]
[discrete]
=== Change analysis for KPI charts

// Naomi--  was beta in 8.8.

KPI change analysis is now GA. You can now use change analysis to directly identify the key drivers for change in your KPIs.

To access this feature, go to your KPI chart and select the caret icon to the right of the percent change label. The *Run change analysis* pop-up allows you to customize the attribute columns ThoughtSpot analyzes to identify the drivers of change. ThoughtSpot runs change analysis for the most recent data point and the past comparison data point as per the KPI chart's configuration.

For more information on change analysis,
ifndef::pendo-links[]
see xref:spotiq-change.adoc#change-analysis-kpi[Comparative analysis].
endif::[]
ifdef::pendo-links[]
see xref:spotiq-change.adoc#change-analysis-kpi[Comparative analysis,window=_blank].

[#9-1-0-cl-heatmap]
[discrete]
=== Disable heatmap data labels

Optionally disable heatmap charts' data labels, and understand the chart quickly by scanning the heatmap colors. This makes complex heatmap charts with many data values easier to read. To try it out, create a heatmap chart, select the *edit chart configuration* icon image:icon-gear-10px.png[edit chart configuration icon image], select *Settings*, and clear the *All labels* checkbox.

[#9-1-0-cl-download]
[discrete]
=== Specify format when downloading charts and tables

// Naomi

We streamlined the file format options when downloading tables and charts from ThoughtSpot. You can download tables in XLSX, CSV, or PDF format, and download charts in XLSX, CSV, or PNG format. To try it out, open a chart or table, and select *Download* from the *more options* menu image:icon-more-10px.png[ellipsis icon]. For more information, see
ifndef::pendo-links[]
xref:search-download.adoc#download-chart-table[Download a chart or table].

[#9-1-0-cl-filter]
[discrete]
=== Change filter order for Liveboard filters

Arrange Liveboard filters in the filter bar so that they are in a logical, coherent order, by dragging and dropping them to different spots in the list. This makes it easier for viewers of the Liveboard to understand and use the filters on the Liveboard. To try it out, edit any Liveboard, and drag and drop the filters in the filter bar.
For more information, see
ifndef::pendo-links[]
xref:liveboard-filters.adoc#order[Change the filter order].

[#9-1-0-cl-or]
[discrete]
=== Text keywords enhancements

We improved the syntax of our text keywords, such as `begins with` and `contains`, to provide users with more flexibility. For example, the `contains` keyword now accepts expressions such as `product name contains 'shoes' or 'snickers'`.
See the
ifndef::pendo-links[]
xref:keywords.adoc#text[Keyword reference].
endif::[]
ifdef::pendo-links[]
xref:keywords.adoc#text[Keyword reference,window=_blank].
endif::[]

Additionally, if your query includes two or more `contains` phrases that modify the same column, ThoughtSpot now combines the phrases using `or` logic, instead of `and`. If you have existing Answers or visualizations using this `and` logic, ThoughtSpot will automatically update your queries after you upgrade to 9.1.0.cl, to ensure they return the same information.
See the
ifndef::pendo-links[]
xref:keywords.adoc#contains[contains keyword].
endif::[]
ifdef::pendo-links[]
xref:keywords.adoc#contains[contains keyword,window=_blank].

[#9-1-0-cl-french]
[discrete]
=== Improvements to French keywords
This release improves the translated French keywords. To try it out, change your ThoughtSpot locale to French, and include keywords in your search.
For more information, see
ifndef::pendo-links[]

[#9-1-0-cl-group-aggregate]
[discrete]
=== Group aggregation enhancements: filters

// Naomi

Group aggregate filter enhancements are GA. Previously, when using group_aggregate formulas, users could use query_filters to include filters entered in the search bar in the formula's value, but it was difficult to write a formula that accepted filters from only a single column.

Starting with this release, you can specify column names within the ‘filters’ section of a group_aggregate formula, and any filter in your search bar referencing that column will be added to the formula. Filters entered in the search bar that are not on columns specified in the third argument of the group_aggregate formula will be ignored. For details, see
ifndef::pendo-links[]
xref:formulas-aggregation-flexible.adoc#groupagg-filters-enhancement[Group aggregation filters].

=== Connect your ThoughtSpot instance to Google Sheets

You can now pull data from a ThoughtSpot instance into Google Sheets using the *ThoughtSpot for connected sheets* extension from the Google Workspace Marketplace. You can connect to any ThoughtSpot instance, even Free Trial. Once connected, you can select your data by using the search bar or selecting it from the data panel, just like in ThoughtSpot. Once you select your data, you can then pull it into Google Sheets and use the available tools to further analyze your data.

=== Parameters

The Parameters feature is now GA. Create Worksheet Parameters to optimize your data inquiries. Use Parameters to run different scenarios with adjustable values, without creating or modifying the constants in formulas for each new value. For example, easily adjust the attribute in an Answer to view your revenue by commit date or order date, as in the following gif. To try it out, edit a Worksheet, and select the *+* button that appears when you hover over the *Parameters* section. For more information about Parameters, see

=== Remove attached files from scheduled emails

// Naomi-- GA

For data security, you may choose to remove attached files from all scheduled Liveboard emails, so that users need to sign in to view updates in Liveboards they follow. When this feature is enabled, scheduled Liveboard email recipients will receive an email with a link to the Liveboard, which they will need to sign in to see. To ensure that only signed-in users can access your data, contact ThoughtSpot Support to enable this option. For more information, see
