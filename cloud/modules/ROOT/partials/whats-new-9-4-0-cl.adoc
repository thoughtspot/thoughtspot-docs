==== Natural language search improvements

// Naomi. Release notes only?? screenshot pointing out the changes. Move to the top. Rename: natural language search. Check if early access or GA (sage features). Clarify the "interactive" point, what can you do now.

We made the following changes to the natural language search feature:

* Redesigned search results page. Filtering facets are now in the left panel.
* You can now interact with the Answers created by natural language search, including sorting values and drilling down.
* Title and descriptions are now automatically created when you save an AI Answer.

// Sage features are disabled by default and available for administrators to enable in the Admin Console.

// Once enabled, your ThoughtSpot administrator can grant access to the *Natural language search* // and *AI-suggested searches* features for users in a group by assigning the *_Can preview // // ThoughtSpot Sage_* user privilege to the group. You do not need this privilege to access // AI-generated Worksheet column synonyms.

=== Contextual change analysis

// Naomi-- add image. clarify if it needs to be enabled by admin or if it's fully GA.

// GA in 9.4.0.cl

Contextual change analysis is now GA and on by default. You can now identify the key change drivers for changes in your metrics in a KPI chart.
Select the percent change label or select any two data points on the KPI sparkline to view change analysis on your top 5 columns by usage-based ranking (UBR) and identify the reason behind the observed change. You can view the changes in other columns by clicking *Customize attributes* and selecting the desired column(s).

// Naomi -- add example and gif! explain reuse

You can now create custom groups, which can be used to classify values in a list you can then reuse across multiple analyses. As an example, you can use custom groups to search for which products are most popular, and define them by sales volume as “gold”, “silver”, or “bronze” level products. Custom groups are community objects which remain when you navigate away from the Search Data page and can be viewed by any user with view access to the underlying Worksheet.

Admin-assigned verifiers can now mark Liveboards as verified. Users can now request these verifiers to review their Liveboards, and verify if the information displayed is trusted content. Verified Liveboards carry a tag that signifies that they have been audited for correctness. To enable this feature, contact {support-url}.

=== Geomap chart enhancements

// Naomi-- reword openstreetmap to describe what it is and what it provides. add value prop of new option (not our past supported countries). add image of multiple countries in a single viz. add in a note-- do they need admin to enable?

ThoughtSpot now supports the following enhancements for geomap visualizations:

* We now provide geomap data for all countries.
* We now support multiple levels of subdivisions within a country, rather than just city and zip code.
* Zip code data is now visualized as an area within a region, rather than a point on a map.
* We now support visualizations comparing subdivisions of multiple countries in a single visualization. For example, if a selected column contains data from cities in the United States and Mexico, all data would be displayed on a single visualization.

We added support for rolling, fixed, and custom date filters when creating an Answer or filtering a Liveboard. Previously, when adding a date filter to a Search, ThoughtSpot supported the conditions `ON (=)`, `ON OR AFTER (>=)`, `BEFORE (<)`, and `BETWEEN`. Now, you can additionally filter for `ON OR BEFORE (\<=)`, `NOT BETWEEN`, `ON LAST`, and `ON NEXT`. To try it out, click the filter icon next to the Date column in the left side menu, or click the date filter below the Answer or Liveboard title. This feature must be enabled by your administrator.

=== Headline creation and pinning deprecation

// Naomi-- move out of other features section

ThoughtSpot is deprecating the pin Headline to Liveboard feature. Beginning in the 9.4.0.cl Cloud release, users will no longer see the pin icon when they hover over table summaries. To visualize and pin single aggregated measures, attributes in string/date format, or time-series metrics with sparklines, you must create

ThoughtSpot Connected Sheets is an add-on that allows you to connect to a ThoughtSpot instance, pull data directly into a Google Sheet from trusted data sources connected to that instance (like Snowflake, Google BigQuery, DataBricks, and others), and use the tools in Google Sheets for ad-hoc analysis.

=== Admin controls for new data panel experience

ThoughtSpot admins now have more control for enabling the new data panel experience for users. As before, an admin can enable the new data panel experience by going to *Admin* > *Early Access features*, and enabling *Data Fluency*. Each user can selectively enable the new data panel experience by going to their user profile, and setting the *Answer data experience* to *New experience*. In this release, admins can now make the new answer data panel experience default for all users of a cluster, by going to *Admin* > *Search & SpotIQ* and setting the *Make new answer data panel experience default* to *Enabled*

We introduced a Liveboard to answer the following questions: +

* How many indexing queries are made?
* Which queries are failing and why?
* How long are the indexing queries taking?
* Which connections have the most failures so that the admin can easily identify them?

Admin users can access the Indexing Queries Liveboard by searching the Liveboards tab, and use the results to improve indexing queries performance.
