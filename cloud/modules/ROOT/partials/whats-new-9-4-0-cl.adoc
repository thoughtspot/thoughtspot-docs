==== Natural language search improvements

// Naomi. Release notes only?? screenshot pointing out the changes. Move to the top. Rename: natural language search. Check if early access or GA (sage features). Clarify the "interactive" point, what can you do now.

We made the following changes to the natural language search feature:

* Redesigned search results page. Filtering facets are now in the left panel.
* You can now interact with the Answers created by natural language search, including sorting values and drilling down.
+
image:nls-drilldown.png[Natural language search answer with a drilldown option]

Sage features are disabled by default and available for administrators to enable in the Admin Console.

Once enabled, your ThoughtSpot administrator can grant access to the *Natural language search* and *AI-suggested searches* features for users in a group by assigning the *_Can preview ThoughtSpot Sage_* user privilege to the group. You do not need this privilege to access AI-generated Worksheet column synonyms.

=== Contextual change analysis



// Naomi-- add image. clarify if it needs to be enabled by admin or if it's fully GA.


// GA in 9.4.0.cl

Contextual change analysis is now GA and on by default. You can now identify the key change drivers for changes in your metrics in a KPI chart. Select the percent change label or select any two data points on the KPI sparkline to view change analysis on your top 5 columns by usage-based ranking (UBR) and identify the reason behind the observed change. You can view the changes in other columns by clicking *Customize attributes* and selecting the desired column(s).

You can now create custom groups, which can be used to classify values in a list you can then reuse across multiple analyses. As an example, you can use custom groups to search for which products are most popular, and define them by sales volume as "gold", "silver", or "bronze" level products. Custom groups are community objects which remain when you navigate away from the Search Data page and can be viewed by any user with view access to the underlying Worksheet.

ThoughtSpot now supports the following enhancements for geomap visualizations:

* We now support multiple levels of subdivisions within a country, rather than just city and zip code.

//* Zip code data is now visualized as an area within a region, rather than a point on a map. You must select *Auto select* in the Geo config column of the source table or Worksheet to access this feature.

* We now support visualizations comparing subdivisions of multiple countries in a single visualization. For example, if a selected column contains data from cities in the United States and Mexico, all data would be displayed on a single visualization.

To enable these features, the *Geo config* property in the underlying Worksheet must be set to *Auto select*. All Worksheets created after 9.4.0.cl GA classify geographical data as *Auto select* by default.

We added support for rolling, fixed, and custom date filters when creating an Answer or filtering a Liveboard. Previously, when adding a date filter to a Search, ThoughtSpot supported the conditions `ON (=)`, `ON OR AFTER (>=)`, `BEFORE (<)`, and `BETWEEN`. Now, you can additionally filter for `ON OR BEFORE (\<=)`, `NOT BETWEEN`, `ON LAST`, and `ON NEXT`. To try it out, click the filter icon next to the Date column in the left side menu, or click the date filter below the Answer or Liveboard title. This feature must be enabled by your administrator.
