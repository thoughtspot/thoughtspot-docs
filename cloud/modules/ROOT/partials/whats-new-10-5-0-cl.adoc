=== Anomaly-based alerts
Anomaly-based alerts are now on by default and available to all users. You can receive alerts when data of KPIs you are subscribed to fall outside the predicted value range.
//To create an anomaly alert, navigate to your KPI, select the more options icon image:icon-more-10px.png[more options menu] on the KPI, click *Manage alerts*, and select *Anomaly*.
When creating an alert, you can specify the time and frequency at which ThoughtSpot checks the KPI’s data against the values predicted by ML models trained on the data. For example, you can create an alert for a `sales weekly` KPI, and specify that ThoughtSpot compare the values every Monday at 5 PM. You may also add individual subscribers to the alert. If the KPI's data falls outside the predicted range, ThoughtSpot sends an alert to your email and, if applicable, your subscribers' emails.

Previously, time-series KPI charts had limited options when comparing to past periods. For example, a weekly KPI could be compared against the previous week, the previous month's same week, the previous quarter's same week, or the previous year's same week. Now, you can set a custom point in data against which ThoughtSpot compares the most recent data point, any number of weeks ago. This feature is applicable to all KPIs including time keywords like `weekly`, `monthly`, or `quarterly`.  Your chosen comparison point persists for all viewers of the KPI. To enable this feature, contact your administrator.

ThoughtSpot users can now define groups for included query values using conditions in Query sets. Conditions allow you to create groups using operators, to specify the parameters of the group.

For example, you could create a query set that list each customer, their sales dollar amount and then add a formula that ranks the amount in descending order. You could then add groups to define GOLD, SILVER, BRONZE levels where Gold is Ranked 1-10, Silver 11-50 and Bronze everyone else.

Admin users now have more control on how users sign in to Connections authenticated using OAuth when the connection authentication has expired.

* Using the Automatic OAuth Sign-in Trigger option in the Early Access panel, admin users can set the *Sign in with OAuth* button to be automatically triggered in a Liveboard, Answer, or Search Data page when the authentication of the underlying Connections expires.
* Using the OAuth Redirection Behavior option in the Early Access panel, admin users can ensure that the connection authentication flow opens in the current page, rather than a new tab.
