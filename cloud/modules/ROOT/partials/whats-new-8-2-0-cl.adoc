[#8-2-0-cl-html-titles-descriptions]
**HTML in answer titles and descriptions**

In the title or description of an answer or visualization in a Liveboard, you can now make any word or phrase a hyperlink by using an `<a href>` HTML tag.

You can also format text as *bold*, _italic_, or #highlighted#.

This feature is available only for answers and visualizations *inside* a Liveboard, and not for the title or description of the Liveboard itself.

*Pivot table scroll bar*

If your pivot table contains more than 2 measures, the column header now has a horizontal scroll bar, so you can see all your measures without taking up excessive space.

[#8-2-0-cl-spotapps]
**ServiceNow and Snowflake SpotApps [.badge.badge-update]#Beta#**

SpotApps are solution templates for specific use cases and data sources. We deliver them to you as pieces of code that you can download and implement directly from our product.

In this release, we introduce *Analytics Blocks*, which include pre-built worksheet, answer, and Liveboard blocks.

We also include the *ServiceNow* and *Snowflake* SpotApps, which mimic the ServiceNow and Snowflake data models. After you connect to your ServiceNow or Snowflake data in your cloud data warehouse, ThoughtSpot maps the data to SpotApp columns, and creates functional and customizable worksheets, answers, and Liveboards.

All these features are part of the data tab redesign, which is in beta.

[#8-2-0-cl-okta]
**Okta authentication [.badge.badge-update]#Beta#**

ThoughtSpot now supports cloud authentication through Okta. When enabled, all user authentication automatically switches to the internal Okta service.

Okta authentication provides significant improvements and security enhancements:

* Okta maps your IDP attributes from the ThoughtSpot Admin console, including username, email, and display name.
* You can monitor account activation in the *Admin > Users* section. You can see if a user does not activate their account, and re-send their activation email.
* Only Okta interacts with your ID
* Local users create their own passwords during account activation. Administrators no longer have to create passwords for them.
