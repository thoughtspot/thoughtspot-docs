=== ServiceNow and Snowflake SpotApps [.badge.badge-beta-whats-new]#Beta#
endif::[]
SpotApps are solution templates for specific use cases and data sources. We deliver them to you as pieces of code that you can download and implement directly from our product.

In this release, we introduce *Analytics Blocks*, which include pre-built Worksheet, Answer, and Liveboard blocks.

We also include the *ServiceNow* and *Snowflake* SpotApps, which mimic the ServiceNow and Snowflake data models. After you connect to your ServiceNow or Snowflake data in your cloud data warehouse, ThoughtSpot maps the data to SpotApp columns, and creates functional and customizable Worksheets, Answers, and Liveboards.

All these features are part of the data tab redesign, which is in beta.
