* Formulas and columns can either have a new name, or a new expression.
You can't change both, unless migrating or updating the Worksheet two times.
* It isn't possible to reverse the join direction in the TML script.
* You can't create new tables using TML files.
You can only update existing tables.
* You can only change logical tables using TML files.
You can't change the physical version of the table that exists in a database.
When you change the `column_name`, for example, the name changes in the application, but not in the physical table in the database.
* You can't create or export TML files for R- or Python-powered visualizations.
* You can't import manually compressed .zip files.
You can only import .zip files that you exported from ThoughtSpot: a custom set of TML files, an object and its associated data sources, or multiple objects of the same type that you exported from the object list page.
* Joins only appear in the table TML file of the source table in a join, or the table on the Many side of a Many-to-One join.
You can only add and edit table joins from the TML file of the table on the Many side of the join.
You can't view or modify table-level joins from the destination table's TML file.
* You can't modify joins at the table level from the Worksheet, view, or Answer TML file.
You can only override the joins for that specific Worksheet, view, or Answer.
To modify table-level joins, you must edit the source table's TML file.
* You can't remove tables from a connection.
You can only add them.
* You can only delete table columns that have no dependents. If the table column has any dependents, ThoughtSpot returns an error when you try to import or validate the TML file. When deleting columns, you only delete ThoughtSpot's record of the column. You don't delete the column in your external database.
