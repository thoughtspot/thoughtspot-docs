ThoughtSpot introduces a seamless and secure sign-in and navigation experience for integrated Analyst Studio users by extending ThoughtSpot SSO and local authentication.

You can now track whether or not row-level security is applied to queries. Risk and compliance analysts can track the volume of queries with row-level security applied versus those without. A row-level security tag is included in the sql query. This provides the ability to determine the number of queries that have included row-level security via the underlying database.
