You can now track whether or not row-level security is applied to queries. Risk and compliance analysts can track the volume of queries with row-level security applied versus those without. A row-level security tag is included in the sql query. This provides the ability to determine the number of queries that have included row level security via the underlying database.

Each query log contains a comment as follows:

ThoughtSpot introduces Org-specific URLs. URLs in emails now include Org context so that users are taken directly to the correct Liveboard in the correct Org even if they belong to multiple Orgs.
You can also move between different browser tabs that point to different Orgs.
