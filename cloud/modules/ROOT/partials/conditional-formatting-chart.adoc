You can use conditional formatting to show charts with a target value or range drawn as a line in the chart, and the legend colors determined by where values fall relative to the target.

To apply conditional formatting to a chart (in this example, _Total Revenue by Supplier Country_), follow these steps:

. Click the *edit chart configuration* icon image:icon-gear-10px.png[] to the upper right of your chart.
The *Edit chart* panel appears, on the *Configure* menu.
Alternatively, you can click the *Conditional formatting* option in the axis menu for the measure you would like to add a conditional formatting rule for.
If the xref:answer-experience-new.adoc[new answer experience] [.badge.badge-update]#Beta# (off by default) is off in your environment, you can only access chart conditional formatting from the axis menu.
. From the *Edit chart* menu, select the measure you would like to add a conditional formatting rule for.
. The *Edit* panel for that column appears.
Under *Conditional formatting*, click *+ Add rule*.
. Select an operator.
The valid options for measures are `less than`, `greater than`, `less than or equal to`, `greater than or equal to`, `equal to`, `not equal to`, and `between`.
. Select the conditional value, or in the case of the `between` operator, the conditional range.
Here, we apply conditional formatting to revenue values between `100 million` and `125 million`.

. To specify a different color of the conditional format, select the new color from the color selector.
+
This option draws upper and lower limit lines on the chart, and colors the chart elements that meet the conditional requirements.

Alternatively, you can place a range band on the chart.
Select the *Fill chart* option.

. To add another condition, click *+ Add rule* below the rule(s) you already created.
. To remove a defined conditional format, navigate to the *Edit* panel for the measure.
Select the *delete* icon that appears when you hover over a rule.
. Click *Done*.

Here, you can see a chart that highlights elements with conditional formatting on some elements.
You can also see how the same chart appears with a background chart band.
