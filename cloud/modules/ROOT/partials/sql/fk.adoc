FOREIGN KEY:: Defines a relationship where the value(s) in the table are used to join to a second table. Uses an equality operator. The foreign key must match the primary key of the table that is referenced in number, column type, and order of columns.
+
When creating a foreign key, give it a name. You can reference the foreign key name later, if you want to remove it.
