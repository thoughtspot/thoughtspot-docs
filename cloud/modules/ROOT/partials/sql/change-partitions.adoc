ALTER TABLE <table> [SET DIMENSION | SET FACT [PARTITION BY HASH [(<shards>)] [KEY(<column>)]]]:: Changes the partitioning on a table by doing one of the following:
+
* re-sharding a sharded table
* changing a replicated table to a sharded table
* changing a sharded table to a replicated (unsharded) table
+
By default, ThoughtSpot does not shard dimension tables.
+
To change the partitioning on a table, or to change a dimension table to a sharded table, use the `ALTER TABLE\...SET FACT PARTITION BY HASH\...;` command.
+
To make a sharded table into a dimension table (replicated on every node),  use the `ALTER TABLE\...SET DIMENSION;` command.
