=== Threshold-based alerts

Threshold-based alerts are now GA and on by default. You can now use the Monitor feature to receive alerts when your KPI satisfies a given threshold condition. For example, create a condition to receive an alert when your Sales KPI becomes `greater than 200,000`, or when your KPI for Sales weekly `increases by 2%`.

[#8-7-0-cl-tabs]
[discrete]
=== Liveboard tabs

ThoughtSpot now supports separating Liveboards into multiple tabs. This allows you to group specific visualizations together within a single Liveboard. For example, you may have a *Sales* Liveboard that contains top-level KPIs and more detailed charts. You can create a tab for the top-level KPIs for executives to view, and a tab for the more detailed charts that managers need to monitor.

You can now sync data directly from an Answer or custom SQL view to an external business app like Google Sheets, Slack, or Microsoft Teams. Using ThoughtSpot Sync, you can push insights directly to your app, notify your teams, and view data in context. ThoughtSpot Sync automatically establishes a secure pipeline to the destination app and thus eliminates the need for building custom connectors to external apps. For more information,

=== Geo charts enhancements

This release includes several enhancements to all geo charts:

* Improved map quality: This includes faster map loading, better clarity, and more granular details down to the street level when you zoom in.
* A new *map type* option that allows you to customize the display of the geo chart map. The new map type options are Light, Dark, Outdoors, Streets, Satellite, and Satellite Streets. The default is Light.

[#8-7-0-cl-or-contains]
[discrete]
=== Support for OR in contains operator

ThoughtSpot now offers the option to combine multiple `contains` clauses in the same search with `OR`, instead of combining them with `AND`, which is the default. For example, with the optional new `OR` behavior, the query `country name contains 'a' country name contains 'b'` returns results such as `Azerbaijan`, `Bahrain`, `North America`, and `Canada`. With the default `AND` behavior, that search returns `Azerbaijan` and `Bahrain`, but *_not_* `North America` or `Canada`.

=== Snowflake OAuth improvements

This release brings improvements in how ThoughtSpot handles user tokens for Snowflake connections configured with Snowflake OAuth. If a user's refresh token becomes invalid, the administrator or author of the connection can now run the Invalidate Tokens command to allow the user to re-authenticate and regain access to the insights provided by the connection, and the connection itself. Also, in this release the _Role_ field has been added to the Snowflake OAuth connection details page, allowing a role to be added when the connection is created and changed when a connection is edited.

In this release, ThoughtSpot switches to a new, industry-standard cloud identity and access management method through Okta. This switch involves several external improvements to authentication:
