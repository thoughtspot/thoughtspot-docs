A CSV file contains a delimiter that marks the separation between fields in the data.
The delimiter is usually a comma, but it can be any character.
The file also contains fields optionally enclosed with double quotes.
Use these guidelines when creating the CSV file:

* As a best practice, use a `|` (pipe) or tab as the delimiter, because those characters are less likely to occur within the data values.
* When a field contains the delimiter, the field must be enclosed in double quotes.

ThoughtSpot supports a wide range of date and timestamp formats in the CSV file. See xref:data-load-date-formats.adoc[].
Blank values in user-uploaded CSV files are interpreted as NULL values.
These include the values (case insensitive):

* `NULL`
* `\N`
* `NA`
* `N/A`
* [space]

If you are appending data to an existing schema or table, columns in the CSV file must be in the same order as defined in the target table.
