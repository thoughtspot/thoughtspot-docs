=== Sage Coach

// Naomi -- SCAL-154204. Santiago is waiting to confirm whether Admin users or Worksheet owners will have access to make feedback apply globally. add a gif. split into two? new user experience and data workspace part.

When giving feedback to AI-generated Answers in Sage, you now tell ThoughtSpot what search tokens to use to signify certain key terms. For example, when you search for "best performing products this year", ThoughtSpot responds with the top five products sorted by sum of sales. You can correct top five to top ten by clicking the thumbs-down icon and editing the Answer. ThoughtSpot then stores that feedback, and admin users and Worksheet owners can decide to apply the feedback globally, so that every time someone searches for "best" products, they receive the top ten results.

Personalized views allow you to save your own set of values for filters and parameters in a Liveboard without editing the original Liveboard.

The new Liveboard is a version of the master Liveboard, so any changes made to the master Liveboard are carried over to the new Liveboard. This includes changes made to pinned visualizations, tabs, filter chips, and re-ordering. Changes made to the new Liveboard are not automatically pushed to the master Liveboard.
