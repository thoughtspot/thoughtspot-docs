=== Give feedback to AI-generated Answers

// Naomi -- SCAL-154204. Santiago is waiting to confirm whether Admin users or Worksheet owners will have access to make feedback apply globally. split into two? new user experience and data workspace part.

When giving feedback to AI-generated Answers in Sage, you now tell ThoughtSpot what search tokens to use to signify certain key terms. For example, when you search for "best performing products this year", ThoughtSpot responds with the top five products sorted by sum of sales. You can correct top five to top ten by clicking the thumbs-down icon and editing the Answer. ThoughtSpot then stores that feedback, and admin users can decide to apply the feedback globally, so that every time someone searches for "best" products, they receive the top ten results.

[#9-8-0-cl-view]
[discrete]
===  Personalized views
Personalized views are now available to all users and on by default. Personalized views allow you to save your own set of values for filters and parameters in a Liveboard. You can change the values of the already present filters and parameters in a Liveboard and save the view for future use. Any changes made to the master Liveboard are carried over to the view, including changes made to pinned visualizations, tabs, filter chips, and re-ordering. Changes made to the view are not pushed to the master Liveboard. This eliminates the need to make multiple copies of a Liveboard with your preferred filter values, that can fall out of sync with the original.
