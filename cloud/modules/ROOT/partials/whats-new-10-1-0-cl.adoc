// PM: Rahul P J P. add gif with result email showing. remove the process, add in an example use case.

You can now receive alerts when data of KPIs you are subscribed to fall outside the predicted value range.
//To create an anomaly alert, navigate to your KPI, select the more options icon image:icon-more-10px.png[more options menu] on the KPI, click *Manage alerts*, and select *Anomaly*.
When creating an alert, you can specify the time and frequency at which ThoughtSpot checks the KPI’s data against the values predicted by ML models trained on the data. For example, you can create an alert for a `sales weekly` KPI, and specify that ThoughtSpot compare the values every Monday at 5 PM. You may also add individual subscribers to the alert. If the KPI's data falls outside the predicted range, ThoughtSpot sends an alert to your email and, if applicable, your subscribers' emails.

The "of" and "percentage of" keywords are now on by default and available to all users. You can use the "of" and "percentage of" keywords to answer questions related to mix, contribution, share of, percentage, and total ratios. These keywords help answer questions such as, "What is the share of a certain store’s sales as a percentage of the regional whole?" To try out this feature, enter a search phrase in the search bar containing the keyword, such as `sales percentage of store region`.

=== Semi-additive measures with first and last values
// Naomi – SCAL-207067. docs JIRA SCAL-214756
// PM: Damian

Semi-additive measures with first and last values are now available to all users and on by default. A semi-additive measure, also known as snapshot data, is a measure that is usually aggregated for all attributes except for date and time. For certain measures, like inventory, you want to know what the value was at the beginning or end of a period. In that case, you can use the `last_value` function to find the inventory at the end of a month, rather than aggregating all values over the month. Similarly, you can use the `first_value` function to find out your stock at the beginning of a month.
