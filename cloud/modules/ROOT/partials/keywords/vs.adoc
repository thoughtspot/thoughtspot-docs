NOTE: ThoughtSpot supports use of multiple `contains`, `begins_with`, and `ends_with` phrases in `vs` queries. For example, you can now have a versus query such as `[state name begins_with 'a'] [state name begins_with 'c'] [vs] [state name begins_with 'd']`. For multiple `begins_with` or `ends_with` phrases on the same side of the `versus` query, ThoughtSpot will combine them using `OR`. For multiple `contains` phrases on the same side of the `versus` query, ThoughtSpot will combine them using `OR` or `AND`, depending on the behavior set in your environment.

NOTE: ThoughtSpot doesn't support the use of group_* formula measures with the `vs` keyword. ThoughtSpot doesn't support the use of the `vs` keyword within an `in` or `not in` subquery.
