//When your search includes multiple `contains` operators for the same attribute, ThoughtSpot combines the clauses with `AND` by default. For example, `country name contains 'a' country name contains 'b'` returns results such as `Azerbaijan` and `Bahrain`, but *_not_* `North America` or `Canada`. You have the option to change the way ThoughtSpot combines the clauses to `OR` instead. Then, `country name contains 'a' country name contains 'b'` returns results such as `Azerbaijan`, `Bahrain`, `North America`, and `Canada`. To enable `OR` instead of `AND` for multiple `contains` clauses, contact {support-url}. Note that making this change may affect backward compatibility for objects built with multiple `contains` clauses.
