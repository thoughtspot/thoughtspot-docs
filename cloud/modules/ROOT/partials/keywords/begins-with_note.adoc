[IMPORTANT]
====
Starting with release 6.3,

* When you use more than one `begins with` or `ends with` keyword in a search or formula on the same column, ThoughtSpot returns your results using an `OR` condition, instead of an `AND` condition.
* When you use a combination of `begins with` and `ends with`, ThoughtSpot still returns your results using the `AND` condition.
* When using multiple `begins with` on different columns, ThoughtSpot returns results using the `AND` condition.

For example, if you search for `state name begins with "V" state name begins with "C"`, your results are Virginia, Vermont, California, and Connecticut.
If you search for `state name begins with V state name ends with T`, your only result is Vermont.
