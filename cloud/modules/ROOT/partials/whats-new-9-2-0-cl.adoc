=== ThoughtSpot Sage
endif::[]

In this release we introduce our new AI-powered search experience called ThoughtSpot Sage, which makes it easier for you to get answers and insights from your complex data. ThoughtSpot Sage uses  a combination of GPT-3, GPT-3.5T and GPT-4, and the large language models (LLM) of the Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service.

Sage features include:

- Natural language search
- AI-suggested searches
- AI-generated Worksheet column synonyms

Sage features are disabled by default and available for select customers to try before they reach GA, when they are enabled by default. To enable ThoughtSpot Sage features, you must contact ThoughtSpot Support.

Once enabled, your ThoughtSpot administrator can grant access to the *Natural language search* and *AI-suggested searches* features for users in a group by assigning the *_Can preview ThoughtSpot Sage_* user privilege to the group. For more information about ThoughtSpot Sage,

Right-click any data point in your Liveboard and easily filter the entire Liveboard by that value. For example, if you right-click *California* in a geo chart on your Liveboard, and then select *Filter*, all the other visualizations only show data from California. A visualization for *Total sales by city*, for example, would only show sales for cities in California. This feature is also called _brushing and linking_. To try it out, select any data point(s) in a Liveboard visualization, and select *Filter* from the menu that appears. This feature must be enabled by your administrator.

=== Change analysis for KPI charts

// Naomi--  was beta in 8.8.

KPI change analysis is now GA. You can now use change analysis to directly identify the key drivers for change in your KPIs.

To access this feature, go to your KPI chart and select the caret icon to the right of the percent change label. The *Run change analysis* pop-up allows you to customize the attribute columns ThoughtSpot analyzes to identify the drivers of change. ThoughtSpot runs change analysis for the most recent data point and the past comparison data point as per the KPI chart's configuration.

=== Change filter order for Liveboard filters

Arrange Liveboard filters in the filter bar so that they are in a logical, coherent order, by dragging and dropping them to different spots in the list.

[#9-2-0-cl-or]
[discrete]
=== Text keywords enhancements

We improved the syntax of our text keywords, such as `begins with` and `contains`, to provide users with more flexibility. For example, the `contains` keyword now accepts expressions such as `product name contains 'shoes' or 'snickers'`.
See the
ifndef::pendo-links[]
xref:keywords.adoc#text[Keyword reference].
endif::[]
ifdef::pendo-links[]
xref:keywords.adoc#text[Keyword reference,window=_blank].
endif::[]

Additionally, if your query includes two or more `contains` phrases that modify the same column, ThoughtSpot now combines the phrases using `or` logic, instead of `and`. If you have existing Answers or visualizations using this `and` logic, ThoughtSpot will automatically update your queries after you upgrade to 9.2.0.cl, to ensure they return the same information.

[#9-2-0-cl-group-aggregate]
[discrete]
=== Group aggregation enhancements: filters

// Naomi

Group aggregate filter enhancements are GA. Previously, when using group_aggregate formulas, users could use query_filters to include filters entered in the search bar in the formula's value, but it was difficult to write a formula that accepted filters from only a single column.

Starting with this release, you can specify column names within the ‘filters’ section of a group_aggregate formula, and any filter in your search bar referencing that column will be added to the formula. Filters entered in the search bar that are not on columns specified in the third argument of the group_aggregate formula will be ignored. For details, see

=== Group aggregate enhancement: reaggregation [.badge.badge-beta-whats-new]#Beta#
endif::[]

// Naomi

To reduce confusion when using aggregate formulas, the level of detail defined in group formulas is now respected at query level. For example, when trying to calculate the contribution of each store’s sales to the entire region, you might use a group_sum formula, where the sales at store level is divided by the sales at regional level. Your search would include the following columns: `Revenue`, `Customer nation`, `Regional Revenue formula`, and `Customer region`, where `Regional Revenue formula =  group_sum(Revenue, Customer Region)`.

According to the old reaggregation behavior, if a customer removed `Customer region` from the search bar, the level of detail in the formula would no longer be respected and the formula’s denominator would re-aggregate up to the total. In this case, the formula result would display revenue as a percentage of total revenue, rather than as a percentage of regional revenue.

Under the new aggregation behavior, the formula result will continue to display revenue as a percentage of each region, even if you remove `Customer region` from the search bar. Visualizations will also display the correct aggregation even if the grouping column is not added to the X-axis.

=== AI-generated Worksheet column synonyms
endif::[]

When you create a Worksheet, ThoughtSpot automatically creates synonyms for each column name. Users can easily start searching on your data, without knowing the exact names for every column. For example, if you have a column named `Product type`, ThoughtSpot might create a synonym such as `Product Category`. When a user searches for revenue by product category, for example, ThoughtSpot returns sales by product type. To try it out, create and save a new Worksheet. Your column name synonyms appear in the *Synonyms* column on the Worksheet details page. This feature must be enabled by ThoughtSpot Support.

=== Cross-Region Disaster Recovery

Cross-Region Disaster Recovery allows ThoughtSpot to recover your ThoughtSpot instance in a secondary cloud region in the case of a failure of the primary cloud region where ThoughtSpot is running. This ensures that if one cloud region fails, ThoughtSpot can start in another region, guaranteeing minimal downtime.

=== Remove attached files from scheduled emails

// Naomi-- GA

For data security, you may choose to remove attached files from all scheduled Liveboard emails, so that users need to sign in to view updates in Liveboards they follow. When this feature is enabled, scheduled Liveboard email recipients will receive an email with a link to the Liveboard, which they will need to sign in to see. To ensure that only signed-in users can access your data, contact {support-url} to enable this option. For more information, see

[#9-2-0-cl-resolution]
[discrete]
=== Scheduled or downloaded Liveboard PDF width

By default, scheduled and downloaded Liveboard PDFs now render at a width of 1920 pixels. This ensures that most Liveboard PDFs you download or schedule look the same as the Liveboards you see in ThoughtSpot. You can also change this default width to a different width for your company, by contacting {support-url}. To try the new default width out, download a PDF of a Liveboard. For more information, see

[#9-2-0-cl-object-usage]
[discrete]
=== Object Usage Liveboard

// Naomi

Use the Object Usage Liveboard to easily track how specific objects (Liveboards, Answers, Worksheets, or tables) are trending over time. Our new visualizations allow you to understand adoption on the object level, and filter on a specific user or users to see usage on the user level.

[#9-2-0-cl-tml-monitor]
[discrete]
=== TML for Monitor alerts

TML for Monitor alerts is now GA. Export, edit, and import KPI Monitor alerts programmatically, using ThoughtSpot Modeling Language. To try it out, export a Liveboard that contains Monitor alerts and its associated objects. For more information, see

[#9-2-0-cl-join-tml]
[discrete]
=== Edit join conditions using TML

Use TML to directly edit a join condition by editing the TML file's *on* parameter. This simplifies the previous process of deleting and recreating the join in TML or the ThoughtSpot application. To try it out, edit a TML file, and update a join's *on* parameter. For more information, see
ifndef::pendo-links[]
xref:tml.adoc#syntax-joins[TML join syntax].
endif::[]
ifdef::pendo-links[]
xref:tml.adoc#syntax-joins[TML join syntax,window=_blank].
endif::[]

[#9-2-0-cl-delete-tml]
[discrete]
=== Delete table columns using TML

Remove columns from tables in ThoughtSpot by deleting them in the tables' TML files. To try it out, edit a table TML file, and delete a column's name and properties. We support deleting a column from a TML file and removing that column's dependencies in the same zip file import. Note that if the deletion of a column fails, the whole import will fail. For more information, see
ifndef::pendo-links[]
xref:scriptability.adoc#delete[Deleting columns, joins, and RLS rules].

=== Join creation for views [.badge.badge-beta-whats-new]#Beta#
endif::[]

// Naomi. Maybe not in the what's new? old join pop-up from views will now be the "new" join UI-- redirect to a join creation page

We standardized the method of creating joins for all data objects in ThoughtSpot. When creating a join from a view, users are now directed to a *Create join* page where they can choose a connection, name the join, and map the source and destination columns.

// ask pm if we want this in the what's new or the release notes. if it simplifies creation, we might want it

[#9-2-0-cl-runtime]
[discrete]
=== Runtime Parameter overrides

Adjust Parameter values at runtime from Liveboard or Answer URLs, or using REST API v1 requests. To try it out, add the Parameter runtime override syntax to any Liveboard or Answer with an active Parameter. For more information, see
ifndef::pendo-links[]
xref:parameters-use.adoc#runtime-overrides[Runtime overrides for Parameters] and https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/?pageid=runtime-params[Runtime Parameters,window=_blank].

endif::[]

[#9-2-0-cl-search-suggestions]
[discrete]
=== Search suggestions on columns with many values

For any column with a high cardinality, which is defined as more than 100,000 unique column values, ThoughtSpot does not index the column if the index type is `DEFAULT`. This means the column values do not show up in search suggestions. Previously, this limit was 1 million unique column values. This change improves performance, and reduces index times and memory usage.

If you have existing columns with a cardinality between 100,000 and 1 million, and you use these columns' search suggestions regularly, ThoughtSpot will continue to index these columns.
For more information, see
ifndef::pendo-links[]
xref:data-modeling-index.adoc#high-cardinality[High cardinality and performance].
endif::[]

[#9-2-0-cl-private-preview]
[discrete]
=== Private Preview features
In this release, we introduce Private Preview features. Private Preview features are complete, and available for select customers to try before they reach GA, when they are enabled by default. To try them out, contact {support-url} to enable these features. Then, administrators can selectively enable or disable this feature set for users and groups, using the *Can preview ThoughtSpot Sage* user privilege. For more information, see
