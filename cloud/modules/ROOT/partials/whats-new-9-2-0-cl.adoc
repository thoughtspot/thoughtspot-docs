[#9-2-0-cl-parameters]
[discrete]
=== Parameters at the Answer level

Any user can now create parameters at the Answer level to optimize their data inquiries. Use parameters to run different scenarios with adjustable values, without creating or modifying the constants in formulas for each new value. For example, easily adjust the attribute in an Answer to view your revenue by commit date or order date, as in the following gif.

[#9-2-0-cl-tml-delete]
[discrete]
=== TML column deletion improvements

We made the following improvements to the deletion of table, Worksheet, View, or SQL View columns using TML:

* We support deleting a column from a TML file and removing that column's dependencies in the same zip file import.

* If the deletion of a column fails, the whole import will fail.

[#9-2-0-cl-search-suggestions]
[discrete]
=== Search suggestions on columns with many values

For any column with a high cardinality, which is defined as more than 100,000 unique column values, ThoughtSpot does not index the column if the index type is `DEFAULT`. This means the column values do not show up in search suggestions. Previously, this limit was 1 million unique column values. This change improves performance, and reduces index times and memory usage.

If you have existing columns with a cardinality between 100,000 and 1 million, and you use these columns' search suggestions regularly, ThoughtSpot will continue to index these columns.
