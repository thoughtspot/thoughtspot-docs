=== ThoughtSpot Sage
endif::[]

In this release we introduce our new AI-powered search experience called ThoughtSpot Sage, which makes it easier for you to get answers and insights from your complex data. ThoughtSpot Sage uses  a combination of GPT-3, GPT-3.5T and GPT-4, and the large language models (LLM) of the Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service.

Sage features include:

- xref:#9-2-0-cl-ai-answers[Natural language search]
- xref:#9-2-0-cl-ai-search[AI-suggested searches]
- xref:#9-2-0-cl-synonyms[AI-generated Worksheet column synonyms]

Sage features are disabled by default and available for select customers to try before they reach GA, when they are enabled by default. To enable ThoughtSpot Sage features, you must contact ThoughtSpot Support.

Once enabled, your ThoughtSpot administrator can grant access to the *Natural language search* and *AI-suggested searches* features for users in a group by assigning the *_Can preview ThoughtSpot Sage_* user privilege to the group.

Right-click any data point in your Liveboard and easily filter the entire Liveboard by that value. For example, if you right-click *California* in a geo chart on your Liveboard, and then select *Filter*, all the other visualizations only show data from California. A visualization for *Total sales by city*, for example, would only show sales for cities in California. This feature is also called _brushing and linking_.

=== Mandatory Liveboard filters

Mandatory Liveboard filters are now GA. Mark certain filters in your Liveboard as mandatory. If you add mandatory filters to a Liveboard, the visualizations will only load after Liveboard viewers select values for the mandatory filters. Use mandatory filters for Liveboards that contain data that may not be relevant for everyone who must view and consume the Liveboard. Mandatory filters also lower query and performance costs.

=== Custom comparison points for KPI charts

// Naomi

You can now set your KPI chart to display a percent change comparison between the most recent data point and a custom comparison point. For example, when searching for `sales monthly`, you can choose to see percent change between this month and the previous month, previous quarter, or previous year.

=== Parameters

The Parameters feature is now GA. Any user can now create Parameters at the Answer level to optimize their data inquiries. Analysts can also create Worksheet Parameters that are available to all Worksheet users. Use Parameters to run different scenarios with adjustable values, without creating or modifying the constants in formulas for each new value. For example, easily adjust the attribute in an Answer to view your revenue by commit date or order date, as in the following image.

=== Change analysis for KPI charts

// Naomi--  was beta in 8.8.

KPI change analysis is now GA. You can now use change analysis to directly identify the key drivers for change in your KPIs.

To access this feature, go to your KPI chart and select the caret icon to the right of the percent change label. The *Run change analysis* pop-up allows you to customize the attribute columns ThoughtSpot analyzes to identify the drivers of change. ThoughtSpot runs change analysis for the most recent data point and the past comparison data point as per the KPI chart's configuration.

// Note that you need SpotIQ privileges to use the KPI change analysis feature.

You can now identify the key change drivers for changes in your metrics in a KPI chart. Select the percent change label or select any two data points on the KPI sparkline to view change analysis on your top 5 columns by usage-based ranking (UBR) and identify the reason behind the observed change. You can view the changes in other columns by clicking *Manage attributes* and selecting the desired column(s). This feature must be enabled by your administrator.

[#9-2-0-cl-heatmap]
[discrete]
=== Disable heatmap data labels

Optionally disable heatmap charts' data labels, and understand the chart quickly by scanning the heatmap colors. This makes complex heatmap charts with many data values easier to read.

=== Specify format when downloading charts and tables

// Naomi

We streamlined the file format options when downloading tables and charts from ThoughtSpot. You can download tables in XLSX, CSV, or PDF format, and download charts in XLSX, CSV, or PNG format.

image::table-download.png[Table download formats]
image::chart-download.png[Chart download formats]

[#9-2-0-cl-filter]
[discrete]
=== Change filter order for Liveboard filters

Arrange Liveboard filters in the filter bar so that they are in a logical, coherent order, by dragging and dropping them to different spots in the list. This makes it easier for viewers of the Liveboard to understand and use the filters on the Liveboard.

[#9-2-0-cl-or]
[discrete]
=== Text keywords enhancements

We improved the syntax of our text keywords, such as `begins with` and `contains`, to provide users with more flexibility. For example, the `contains` keyword now accepts expressions such as `product name contains 'shoes' or 'snickers'`.

Additionally, if your query includes two or more `contains` phrases that modify the same column, ThoughtSpot now combines the phrases using `or` logic, instead of `and`. If you have existing Answers or visualizations using this `and` logic, ThoughtSpot will automatically update your queries after you upgrade to 9.2.0.cl, to ensure they return the same information.

[#9-2-0-cl-french]

=== Improvements to French keywords
This release improves the translated French keywords.

[#9-2-0-cl-group-aggregate]
[discrete]
=== Group aggregation enhancements: filters

// Naomi

Group aggregate filter enhancements are GA. Previously, when using group_aggregate formulas, users could use query_filters to include filters entered in the search bar in the formula's value, but it was difficult to write a formula that accepted filters from only a single column.

Starting with this release, you can specify column names within the ‘filters’ section of a group_aggregate formula, and any filter in your search bar referencing that column will be added to the formula. Filters entered in the search bar that are not on columns specified in the third argument of the group_aggregate formula will be ignored.

ifdef::pendo-links[]
[#9-2-0-cl-group-aggregate-reagg]
[discrete]
=== Group aggregate enhancement: reaggregation [.badge.badge-beta-whats-new]#Beta#
endif::[]
// Naomi
To reduce confusion when using aggregate formulas, the level of detail defined in group formulas is now respected at query level. For example, when trying to calculate the contribution of each store’s sales to the entire region, you might use a group_sum formula, where the sales at store level is divided by the sales at regional level. Your search would include the following columns: `Revenue`, `Customer nation`, `Regional Revenue formula`, and `Customer region`, where `Regional Revenue formula =  group_sum(Revenue, Customer Region)`.

According to the old reaggregation behavior, if a customer removed `Customer region` from the search bar, the level of detail in the formula would no longer be respected and the formula’s denominator would re-aggregate up to the total. In this case, the formula result would display revenue as a percentage of total revenue, rather than as a percentage of regional revenue.

Under the new aggregation behavior, the formula result will continue to display revenue as a percentage of each region, even if you remove `Customer region` from the search bar. Visualizations will also display the correct aggregation even if the grouping column is not added to the X-axis.

=== AI-generated Worksheet column synonyms
endif::[]

When you create a Worksheet, ThoughtSpot automatically creates synonyms for each column name. Users can easily start searching on your data, without knowing the exact names for every column. For example, if you have a column named `Product type`, ThoughtSpot might create a synonym such as `Product Category`. When a user searches for revenue by product category, for example, ThoughtSpot returns sales by product type.

[#9-2-0-cl-disaster-recovery]
[discrete]
=== Cross-Region Disaster Recovery

Cross-Region Disaster Recovery allows ThoughtSpot to recover your ThoughtSpot instance in a secondary cloud region in the case of a failure of the primary cloud region where ThoughtSpot is running. This ensures that if one cloud region fails, ThoughtSpot can start in another region, guaranteeing minimal downtime.

=== Delete table columns using TML

Remove columns from tables in ThoughtSpot by deleting them in the tables' TML files. We support deleting a column from a TML file and removing that column's dependencies in the same zip file import. Note that if the deletion of a column fails, the whole import will fail.

=== Search suggestions on columns with many values

For any column with a high cardinality, which is defined as more than 100,000 unique column values, ThoughtSpot does not index the column if the index type is `DEFAULT`. This means the column values do not show up in search suggestions. Previously, this limit was 1 million unique column values. This change improves performance, and reduces index times and memory usage.

If you have existing columns with a cardinality between 100,000 and 1 million, and you use these columns' search suggestions regularly, ThoughtSpot will continue to index these columns.
