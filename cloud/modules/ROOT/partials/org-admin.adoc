Cluster administrators and Org administrators have some of the same privileges and responsibilities. While these roles overlap, they are not the same.

*Cluster administrators* can do the following tasks:

* Org management: creating, editing, and deleting Orgs
* User management for any user in any Org
* Group management for any group in any Org
* Connection management: creating, editing, and deleting any connection in any Org. Cluster admins can also xref:connections.adoc#connection-share[share connections] with Org admins and users with the *can manage data* permission, allowing those users to add, remove, and modify tables in the connection.

For a cluster administrator, the Admin Console in the *Primary Org* has an *All orgs* section, to manage cross-Org configuration, and a *Primary org* section, to manage configuration for the Primary Org.

*Org administrators* can do the following tasks:

* User management for any user in the Org(s) in which the Org administrator has admin privileges
* Group management for any group in the Org(s) in which the Org administrator has admin privileges
* Connection management: creating, editing, and deleting the connections in the Orgs in which the Org administrator has admin privileges. By default, Org administrators do *not* have view or edit access to connections created by cluster administrators, unless the cluster admin shares the connection with them. If a cluster admin xref:connections.adoc#connection-share[shares a connection] with them, Org admins can add, remove, and modify tables in that connection.

For an Org administrator, the Admin Console does *_not_* have an *All orgs* section. The Org administrator can only manage configuration for their specific Org.
