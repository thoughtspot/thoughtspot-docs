Your data's security is important. ThoughtSpot encrypts all your data by default. For an additional layer of security and network reliability, you can use an AWS PrivateLink.
This option is currently available for your Amazon Aurora MySQL, Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL, Amazon RDS MySQL, Amazon RDS PostgreSQL, Amazon Redshift, Databricks, Denodo, Dremio, Oracle, PostgreSQL, SAP HANA, Snowflake, SQL Server, Starburst, or Teradata data warehouse connections.

ThoughtSpot supports a maximum of five PrivateLinks in your environment, in any combination of supported cloud data warehouses. For example, you could have a PrivateLink for Denodo, one for Databricks, and one for Starburst in the same environment.
