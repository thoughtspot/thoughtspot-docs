[#search-data-error-11028]

=== 11028

Description:: Data samples are not supported for Models with chasm traps. Use Search to get sample data.

Details:: When a user selects the Data Samples tab from a Model, ThoughtSpot attempts to display 50 rows of data. If a chasm trap query plan is detected, then a warning message is displayed to the user.



Cause:: Schemas that may have multiple fact tables are joined through shared dimensional tables. This is known as a chasm trap. ThoughtSpot supports chasm traps for analysis. However, these are not supported for Model data samples. Refer to the xref:chasm-trap.adoc[Chasm trap article] for further details.

Resolution:: Leverage Search Data to review columns and their values.
