[#search-data-error-11027]

=== 11027

Description:: Query must include at least one base table column.

Details:: This error is displayed when the search data query has not selected a token that references a column from the underlying database.



Cause:: With formulas it is possible to create ThoughtSpot columns that do not reference the underlying database. The following is a simple example formula. If a search is defined with this single token, then the error will be displayed.
+
`Current Date = today()`
+
A second example could involve a parameter, where the user has created a formula to calculate the number of days between the date specified by the parameter and the current date. As this formula does not reference a column in the database, this would return an error if this formula was the only token in the search.
+
`Days Difference = diff_days(parameterDate, today())`

Resolution:: Update the search to include a column that references the underlying database.
