=== For the First User

Getting started with ThoughtSpot Cloud::
The first user on the account has to complete a series of steps before other people can start using ThoughtSpot with your organization's data.
For these instructions, see xref:ts-cloud-getting-started.adoc[Getting Started with ThoughtSpot Cloud].

[#9-11-0-cl-analyst]
=== For the Analyst

Renaming columns::
You can now rename columns in an Answer and see the new name reflected on the table header, tooltips, legend, and chart configuration menu. Changes made to an Answer are not reflected in the underlying Worksheet. For more information, see xref:chart-column-axis-rename.adoc#column-rename[Rename a table column].

Models [.badge.badge-early-access-relnotes]#Early Access#::
With Models, we've completely redesigned how you model your data in ThoughtSpot. With the Model editor, you can drag and drop tables and columns, create joins, and much more in an intuitive, tabbed interface which streamlines your workflow. Models will replace Worksheets in the future, but in this release you can create and use Models or Worksheets. To enable this feature, contact your administrator.
For more information, see xref:models.adoc[Models].

// Naomi -- scal-174127, documentation JIRA scal-201041 (approved)
ThoughtSpot Sync for Google BigQuery [.badge.badge-beta-relnotes]#Beta#::
Using ThoughtSpot Sync, you can now sync data directly from an Answer or a custom SQL view, to your Google BigQuery cloud data warehouse. To enable this feature, contact {support-url}.
For more information, see xref:sync-gbq.adoc[Sync to Google BigQuery].

// Naomi -- scal-176730, documentation JIRA 201311 (approved)
ThoughtSpot Sync from unsaved Answers:: You can now create syncs from Answers without saving first.

Tooltip customization::
Customize tooltips to make charts easier to read and reduce the time to insights for business users. Use customized tooltips to add measures, attributes, and formulas that are not visualized in the chart. You can also customize tooltips to remove certain fields from the tooltips in a complex chart so that users are not overwhelmed with irrelevant information.
Configure tooltips by selecting the *Edit chart configuration* icon image:icon-gear-10px.png[chart customization icon] and selecting *Settings*. Under *Tooltip* click *Edit tooltip*. By default, fields visualized in charts are included in the tooltip. You can remove, add, or rearrange fields. For more information, see xref:chart-tooltip-customize.adoc[Customize tooltips].

Advanced conditional formatting [.badge.badge-early-access-relnotes]#Early Access#::
Rather than simply using conditional formatting comparing a column's measures to a single value (for example, `sales > 10000`), you can now use conditional formatting to compare a column's measures to another column or to a parameter. For example, if you search for `sales this year` versus `sales last year`, you can highlight where sales this year were less than last year. You can set multiple conditional formatting rules to a single table.
For more information, see xref:search-conditional-formatting.adoc#advanced-conditional-formatting[Advanced conditional formatting].

ThoughtSpot Sync for Google BigQuery::
ThoughtSpot Sync for Google BigQuery is now on by default and available to all users. Using ThoughtSpot Sync, you can now sync data directly from an Answer or a custom SQL view, to your Google BigQuery cloud data warehouse.
For more information, see xref:sync-gbq.adoc[Sync to Google BigQuery].

// Mary -- SCAL-150356
Custom sets [.badge.badge-early-access-whats-new]#Early Access#::
You can create custom sets, which can be used to classify values in a list that you can then reuse across multiple analyses. ThoughtSpot introduces custom column sets in this release. A column set is a custom group of values from a single column. For example, you can use custom sets to define regions with specific countries included or excluded. Custom sets are community objects which remain when you navigate away from the Search Data page and can be used by any user with view access to the underlying Worksheet. To enable this feature, contact {support-url}. For more information, see xref:custom-sets.adoc[Custom sets].

AI Highlights [.badge.badge-early-access-relnotes]#Early Access#::

With AI Highlights, you get quick insights on how top metrics have changed in your Liveboard, dramatically reducing the time to derive insights from your KPIs. To enable this feature, contact your administrator.
For more information, see xref:liveboard-ai-highlights.adoc[AI Highlights].

Keywords "of", "percentage of" [.badge.badge-beta-relnotes]#Beta#:: To enable business users to answer questions related to mix, contribution, share of, percentage, and total ratios, we added the keywords “of” and “percentage of”. These keywords help answer questions such as “What is the share of a certain store’s sales as a percentage of the regional whole?” To try out this feature, enter a search phrase in the search bar containing the keyword, such as `sales percentage of store region`, and press *Go*. +
For more information, see
xref:formulas-keywords.adoc[Keywords: Of and Percentage of].

Mode connector [.badge.badge-early-access-relnotes]#Early Access#:: ThoughtSpot now supports connections to Mode.

For more information, see
xref:connections-mode.adoc[Connect to Mode].

Click and drag to create joins with Models [.badge.badge-early-access-relnotes]#Early Access#::

Feedback review::
We made the following changes to ThoughtSpot feedback review for AI Answers:

* Feedback for AI Answers is now Org-aware.
* When you make a change to a Worksheet, ThoughtSpot now alerts you if this will affect any related query feedback. If you accept this and make the change, the feedback depending on that Worksheet is deleted.
//* You can now import query feedback when you move information from a development cluster to a production cluster.

// Naomi -- SCAL-126451
Sharing dbt connections::
You can now select a dbt connection and click *Share* to share the connection with other users or groups. You can select whether to allow edit access to the dbt user from the *Share connection* dialog box. For more information, see
xref:dbt-integration.adoc#share[Share a dbt connection].

// Naomi -- SCAL-180960
dbt error message handling::
ThoughtSpot displays dbt error messages that clearly describe whether the error originated in dbt or in ThoughtSpot, where the error was encountered, and what steps users should take to resolve the issue. For a list of the error messages ThoughtSpot supports, see
xref:dbt-integration.adoc#errors[dbt error messages].

// Naomi -- SCAL-126453, SCAL-201305
dbt connections join enhancement::
When creating a Worksheet from a dbt connection, ThoughtSpot joins the tables based on the relationships defined in the underlying .yml schema file. Now, joins between the tables will be created local to the Worksheet instead of creating a global join between the tables.

// Naomi -- SCAL-164290, SCAL-201306
Ts_Groups system variable::
ThoughtSpot now supports the `ts_groups` system variable in Answer and Worksheet formulas. You can use the `ts_groups` variable for data masking, or deciding whether to display the value of a column to a user based on their group membership.

// Naomi -- SCAL-178532, SCAL-201307
Enhancements to error messages for Search and Answers::
To improve our error messaging when an error prevents data from loading, we introduced a broader classification that allows you to understand issues more clearly. You can click "Copy error details" to download and send a file to your administrators.

// Doc jira: SCAL-202377
Answer data panel enhancements::
Now in the new Answer data panel, you can filter as you hover on a column, _By category_ grouping by default, and display the information panel when you click a column.
