Learnability in conversation: feedback generation in follow-up questions::
You can now give feedback on AI-generated Answers in Spotter without interrupting your searching conversation.

Alerts by attribute [.badge.badge-early-access-relnotes]#Early Access#::
You can now set KPI alerts to trigger at changes to a selected attribute.

For example, if you wanted to create an alert for a KPI tracking sales of different phones by brand, you could choose the intended brands as attributes and set an alert to be notified when sales for those specific brands dropped by 5%. To enable this feature, contact your administrator.
