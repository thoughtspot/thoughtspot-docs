[#9-10-0-cl-first]
=== For the First User

Getting started with ThoughtSpot Cloud::
The first user on the account has to complete a series of steps before other people can start using ThoughtSpot with your organization's data.
For these instructions, see xref:ts-cloud-getting-started.adoc[Getting Started with ThoughtSpot Cloud].

[#9-10-0-cl-analyst]
=== For the Analyst

// Naomi -- scal-182100, documentation JIRA scal-201040
Renaming columns::
You can now rename columns in an Answer and see the new name reflected on the table header, tooltips, legend, and chart configuration menu. Changes made to an Answer are not reflected in the underlying Worksheet. For more information, see xref:chart-column-axis-rename.adoc#column-rename[Rename a table column].

// Mark -- SCAL-192432
Models [.badge.badge-early-access-relnotes]#Early Access#::
With Models, we've completely redesigned how you model your data in ThoughtSpot. With the Model editor, you can drag and drop tables and columns, create joins, and much more in an intuitive, tabbed interface which streamlines your workflow. Models will replace Worksheets in the future, but in this release you can create and use Models or Worksheets. To enable this feature, contact your administrator.
For more information, see xref:models.adoc[Models].

// Naomi -- scal-174127, documentation JIRA scal-201041 (approved)
ThoughtSpot Sync for Google BigQuery [.badge.badge-beta-relnotes]#Beta#::
Using ThoughtSpot Sync, you can now sync data directly from an Answer or a custom SQL view, to your Google BigQuery cloud data warehouse. To enable this feature, contact {support-url}.
For more information, see xref:sync-gbq.adoc[Sync to Google BigQuery].

// Naomi -- scal-176730, documentation JIRA 201311 (approved)
ThoughtSpot Sync from unsaved Answers:: You can now create syncs from Answers without saving first.

//Mary -- scal-143396, scal-163885, Doc JIRA scal-201631
Tooltip customization::
Customize tooltips to make charts easier to read and reduce the time to insights for business users. Use customized tooltips to add measures, attributes, and formulas that are not visualized in the chart. You can also customize tooltips to remove certain fields from the tooltips in a complex chart so that users are not overwhelmed with irrelevant information.
Configure tooltips by selecting the *Edit chart configuration* icon image:icon-gear-10px.png[chart customization icon] and selecting *Settings*. Under *Tooltip* click *Edit tooltip*. By default, fields visualized in charts are included in the tooltip. You can remove, add, or rearrange fields. For more information, see xref:chart-tooltip-customize.adoc[Customize tooltips].

// Naomi -- scal-177005
Advanced conditional formatting [.badge.badge-early-access-relnotes]#Early Access#::
Rather than simply using conditional formatting comparing a column's measures to a single value (for example, `sales > 10000`), you can now use conditional formatting to compare a column's measures to another column or to a parameter. For example, if you search for `sales this year` versus `sales last year`, you can highlight where sales this year were less than last year. You can set multiple conditional formatting rules to a single table. For more information, see xref:search-conditional-formatting.adoc#advanced-conditional-formatting[Advanced conditional formatting].

Functional enhancements for verified Liveboards::
You can now easily search for verified Liveboards with trusted content, and filter to view only verified content. Verified Liveboards are identified with a tag visible in all screens.
You can also cancel verification requests when needed.

// Mark -- SCAL-189664
Deprecation of SpotApps::
In this release, you will still be able to use SpotApps, but ThoughtSpot will remove the SpotApps UI in a later release. Though we will be removing the UI, you will still be able to upload pre-built SpotApp templates. For details, see xref:deprecation.adoc[Deprecated and removed features].



[#9-10-0-cl-business-user]
=== For the Business User




// Naomi -- scal-169683, documentation JIRA scal-201035 (approved)
Null and missing values in charts::
You can now choose how null and missing values appear in line, column, and bar charts in ThoughtSpot. Null and missing values appear as bars of 1 pixel width on bar and column charts. You can choose whether to display null date values as zero values, line breaks, or an average of proximate values on a line chart. Rather than showing a sharp decline to zero every time there is null or missing data on your line chart, you can see the missing values represented as line breaks or averages of the closest values instead. For more information, see
xref:chart-null-missing.adoc[Null and missing values in charts].

Ask Sage:: You can now conversationally search ThoughtSpot using natural language, asking follow-up questions for further clarification or to take your analysis in a new direction.

// Naomi -- scal-141936, scal-176265, documentation JIRA scal-178860 (approved)
Iterative change analysis [.badge.badge-beta-relnotes]#Beta#::
You can now drill down on specific columns in change analysis, in order to identify change drivers within your data. For example, if you run an analysis on sales monthly and find out that the 'jacket' item type changed the most, you can easily drill down on jacket sales and identify which region contributed the most to the change in sales. For more information, see xref:spotiq-change.adoc#iterative[Iterative change analysis].

// Naomi -- SCAL-127727, SCAL-164086, documentation JIRA scal-201033 (approved)
Contextual alert creation on KPI charts:: ThoughtSpot now preserves the filters you use on a KPI when you create a Monitor alert. Users with view access to the underlying Liveboard can now receive alert emails for filtered KPIs without saving the filters on the Liveboard. For more information, see xref:monitor.adoc[Monitor alerts].

// Naomi -- SCAL-159819, documentation JIRA scal-201314 (approved)
ThoughtSpot for Slack [.badge.badge-early-access-relnotes]#Early Access#::

// Naomi -- scal-159515, documentation JIRA scal-201031 (approved)
Commenting on Liveboards:: You can now add or reply to comments, tag other users, or subscribe to comment threads directly on a Liveboard. Users can point out insights or reach out for clarification without leaving ThoughtSpot. To try it out, click the comment icon to the right of the edit icon, and select the data point you would like to comment on. For more information, see xref:liveboard-comment.adoc[].

// Naomi -- scal-173345, scal-89341, documentation JIRA scal-201032 (approved)

You can see the expected range of values, and click a link to view your KPI in the original Liveboard. To enable this feature, contact your administrator. For more information, see
xref:monitor.adoc#early-access[Monitor].



// Naomi -- scal-166121, documentation JIRA scal-201034. actually EA. (approved)
Chart customizations [.badge.badge-early-access-relnotes]#Early Access#:: You can now access advanced chart customization settings for Answers by selecting the *Edit chart configuration* icon image:icon-gear-10px.png[chart customization icon] and selecting *Advanced settings*.

For more information, see xref:chart-settings-advanced.adoc[Advanced chart settings].


// Naomi -- scal-147558, documentation JIRA scal-201036 (approved)
Change analysis: remember personalized columns [.badge.badge-early-access-relnotes]#Early Access#::
Users with edit permissions on a Liveboard can set their preferred attribute columns through the change analysis window and select *Apply to all users* to keep those selections for any subsequent change analysis calculations on that Liveboard. Individual users can still override these preferences for their own calculations. For more information, see xref:spotiq-change.adoc#remember-personalized[Remember personalized columns].



// Naomi -- scal-156247, documentation JIRA scal-201037 (approved)
Natural language search chart type:: You can now specify the answering chart type when you use Natural Language Search. For example, search for "sales by region pie chart", and the results appear in pie chart format. For more information, see xref:ai-answers.adoc[].


// Naomi -- scal-177253, documentation JIRA scal-201038 (approved)
Add formula or parameter to Answer::
You can now add a formula or parameter to an Answer by navigating to the *Category* image:icon-by-category.png[Category view] or *A to Z* image:icon-a-to-z.png[Alphabetical view] view of the Data panel, clicking *+ Add*, and selecting *Formula* or *Parameter*.

//Mary scal-174139, scal-158579, scal-174139, Doc JIRA SCAL-201628
Roles and more granular access privileges:: ThoughtSpot introduces role-based access control (RBAC) to allow for more granular access privileges. Use roles to apply privileges customized for your organizational needs.
ThoughtSpot includes some standard roles to help existing customers transition to RBAC. RBAC is supported in Primary Orgs. To enable RBAC, contact {support-url}. For more information, see xref:rbac.adoc[Understand RBAC and privileges].

Mobile enhancements:: We made the following improvements to ThoughtSpot mobile:

* We simplified the log in process for the ThoughtSpot mobile app. You can now enter your company email to receive an email with a magic link login, rather than entering the server URL.
* ThoughtSpot now supports IAMv2 login.
* You can now change your ThoughtSpot locale through the Mobile app. When your locale is updated, ThoughtSpot translates labels, date formats and number formats to match the default for your country and language.
* You can now use SpotIQ analysis to directly identify the key drivers for recent change in your KPIs in ThoughtSpot Mobile. KPI change analysis allows you to drill down into the causes of change in your KPIs and customize the insights generated by SpotIQ.
To access this feature, go to your KPI chart and select the caret icon to the right of the percent change label. The *Run change analysis* pop-up allows you to customize the columns ThoughtSpot analyzes. Note that ThoughtSpot runs change analysis between the two most recent data points defined by the KPI’s time bucket (for example, `daily` or `weekly`).
* We introduced improved deep linking to ThoughtSpot mobile. When you click a link you no longer need to choose whether you want to view the link in your default mobile browser or the ThoughtSpot app. The default behavior is to open the link in ThoughtSpot if it is supported.
* You can now receive ThoughtSpot mobile push notifications. Receive push notifications when a Liveboard or Answer is shared with you. Monitor scheduled and threshold alerts with push notifications.
