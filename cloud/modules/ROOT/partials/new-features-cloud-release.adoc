[#9-3-0-cl-first]
=== For the First User

Getting started with ThoughtSpot Cloud::
The first user on the account has to complete a series of steps before other people can start using ThoughtSpot with your organization's data.
For these instructions, see xref:ts-cloud-getting-started.adoc[Getting Started with ThoughtSpot Cloud].

Free Trial CSV upload limit increase:: We increased the CSV upload limit in Free Trial to ten files per user. For more information, see
xref:csv-load-free-trial.adoc[Load CSV files in Free Trial].


[#9-3-0-cl-analyst]
=== For the Analyst

AI-generated Worksheet column synonyms [.badge.badge-early-access-relnotes]#Early Access#::

When you create a Worksheet, ThoughtSpot automatically creates synonyms for each column name. This feature is now available for administrators to enable by default, without contacting ThoughtSpot Support. Users can easily start searching on your data, without knowing the exact names for every column. For example, if you have a column named `Product type`, ThoughtSpot might create a synonym such as `Product Category`. When a user searches for revenue by product category, for example, ThoughtSpot returns sales by product type. This feature must be enabled by your administrator.
For more information, see
xref:data-modeling-visibility.adoc#automatic-synonyms[Create synonyms for a column].


Liveboard note tiles::

The Liveboard note tiles feature is now GA. Add notes to your Liveboards, so that viewers of your Liveboards can quickly understand how to use the data and visualizations you gathered. Note tiles can provide an overview of a Liveboard or visualization, company branding through images, definitions of terms used in the Liveboard, and so on. With the GA of the note tiles feature, you don't need a specific privilege to upload images. See xref:liveboard-notes.adoc[Liveboard note tiles].

Change filter order for Answer filters::

Arrange Answer filters in the filter bar so that they are in a logical, coherent order, by dragging and dropping them to different spots in the list. This makes it easier for viewers of the Answer to understand and use the filters on the Answer. For more information, see xref:filters.adoc#order[Change the filter order].


////
Date picker enhancement in Search:: We added support for rolling, fixed, and custom date filters when creating an Answer. Previously, when adding a date filter to a Search, ThoughtSpot supported the conditions `ON (=)`, `ON OR AFTER (>=)`, `BEFORE (<)`, and `BETWEEN`. Now, you can additionally filter for `ON OR BEFORE (\<=)`, `NOT BETWEEN`, `ON LAST`, and `ON NEXT`. To try it out, click the filter icon next to the Date column in the left side menu, or click the date filter below the Answer title.

[#9-3-0-cl-business-user]
=== For the Business User

AI-generated answers [.badge.badge-early-access-relnotes]#Early Access#:: You can now use natural language to search for answers to your business questions. This feature is now available for administrators to enable, without contacting ThoughtSpot Support. To try it out, navigate to the Home page, select the search bar labeled *Ask any business question you have* and type your question. When you enter your question, you will see the AI generated answer appear, along with a list of related Answers created by users in your team.
+
You can select the Worksheet to search on by clicking the Worksheet title in the left side of the search bar and selecting a new Worksheet from the dropdown. Worksheets with AI answers enabled display a triangular icon to the left of the Worksheet name: image:icon-ai-answer.png[AI answer enabled icon].

AI-suggested searches [.badge.badge-early-access-relnotes]#Early Access#::
The AI-suggested searches feature helps you think of relevant questions to ask of your own data source, by providing examples of searches. This feature is now available for administrators to enable, without contacting ThoughtSpot Support. This feature is designed to help you get started if you are a new user of Search Data, or if you are working with a new Worksheet.
For more information, see xref:search-ai-suggested.adoc[AI-suggested searches]. This feature must be enabled by your administrator.

Liveboard cross filters::

Liveboard cross filters are now GA. Right-click on any data point in your Liveboard and easily filter the entire Liveboard by that value. For example, if you right-click *California* in a geo chart on your Liveboard, and then select *Filter*, all the other visualizations only show data from California. A visualization for *Total sales by city*, for example, would only show sales for cities in California. This feature is also called _brushing and linking_. For more information, see
xref:liveboard-filters-cross.adoc[Liveboard cross filters].

Contextual change analysis [.badge.badge-early-access-relnotes]#Early Access#::
You can now identify the key change drivers for changes in your metrics in a KPI chart. Select the percent change label or select any two data points on the KPI sparkline to view change analysis on your top 5 columns by usage-based ranking (UBR) and identify the reason behind the observed change. You can view the changes in other columns by clicking *Manage attributes* and selecting the desired column(s). This feature must be enabled by your administrator.
+
For more information, see
xref:spotiq-change.adoc#change-analysis-contextual[Contextual change analysis].

Keywords "of", "percentage of" [.badge.badge-beta-relnotes]#Beta#:: To enable business users to answer questions related to mix, contribution, share of, percentage, and total ratios, we added the keywords “of” and “percentage of”. These keywords help answer questions such as “What is the share of a certain store’s sales as a percentage of the regional whole?” Previously, searches such as these required the use of a group aggregate formula, which presented a barrier to users. To try out this feature, enter a search phrase in the search bar containing the keyword, such as `sales percentage of store region`, and press *Go*. +
For more information, see
xref:formulas-keywords.adoc[Keywords: Of and Percentage of]. This feature is off by default. To enable it, contact {support-url}.

Attributes in pivot table cells:: You can now include attributes in the pivot table cells as well as measures. This is useful for cases when you want to summarize text data such as user role, pass/fail, or other attributes. For more information, see
xref:chart-pivot-table.adoc#attributes[Pivot table charts].

Ability to change legend position:: You can now configure the legend position of a chart, or hide the legend. The available options are left, right, above, and below the visualization. To try it out, open the chart configuration menu, select *Settings*, and choose between *Legend on right*, *Legend on left*, *Legend on top*, and *Legend on bottom*. You can select the Show legend toggle to hide or show the legend. See
xref:chart-change.adoc#legend[Changing charts].

Liveboard header visible when you scroll down::
When you scroll down in a Liveboard, the Liveboard name, menu options, and filter and tab bars remain visible. You don't need to scroll back up to the top to edit the Liveboard or check if you're filtering by a specific store. You can see the filters or parameters applied to the Liveboard, select the *Edit* button or more options image:icon-more-10px.png[more options menu icon] menu, and view which tab you're on from any spot in the Liveboard.

Optionally change contextual menu to left-click::

In this release, we introduce the option change the contextual menu interaction to left-click. Then, you can access the contextual menu for visualization data points with a left click. Instead of right-clicking on a data point to include or exclude it, drill down on it, or show underlying data, now you can access the menu more easily, with a single left click.
+
This feature is off by default. To enable it, contact {support-url}.

+
--
* Ability to connect to a single-tenant dbt environment.

Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL connection and Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) PostgreSQL connection::
You can now connect to and query Amazon Aurora and Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL databases using the PostgreSQL connector.
//For details, see xref:connections-amazon-aurora-postgresql.adoc[Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL] and xref:connections-amazon-rds-postgresql.adoc[Amazon RDS PostgreSQL].



MySQL connection::
You can now create connections from ThoughtSpot to MySQL. For details, see
xref:connections-mysql.adoc[MySQL].

Specify default connection for CSV uploads:: Previously, when multiple database connections were configured to receive CSV uploads without a specified table or worksheet for collocation, the files were randomly uploaded to one of the connections. With this new enhancement, administrators and data managers now have the ability to specify a default target connection for such uploads. +
To set the default target connection, navigate to *Data > Connections*, click the *More* menu icon image:icon-more-10px.png[menu icon], select *Configure data upload*, and click the *Enable data upload* toggle to on. By specifying a default connection, you ensure that CSV files without a designated destination will be uploaded to the chosen connection.
This enhancement provides better control and organization of CSV uploads, making it easier to manage data in scenarios where end-users do not select a co-location for their uploaded files.

In-app billing reporting:: Admin users will be able to access a Liveboard reflecting the pricing model purchased and associated with their cluster. Query-based pricing customers see the xref:query-stats.adoc[Billable Query Stats Liveboard], while time-based pricing customers see the xref:consumption-pricing-time-based.adoc#credit-usage-pinboard[Credit Usage Liveboard].
