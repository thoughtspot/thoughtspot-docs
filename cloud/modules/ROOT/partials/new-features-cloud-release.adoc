You can ask successive questions to hone in on business insights, open a preview of the underlying data, drill down, edit or undo changes to the resulting AI-generated Answers, see what terms Spotter changed from question to question, and submit feedback to train Spotter's interpretations. Analysts can also coach Spotter on how to interpret certain terms from the Admin page.

Chart visualization enhancements::
We made the following changes to visualizations on Liveboards:
+
--
* You can now hover over items in a visualization's legend to highlight the data that corresponds to that column.
* You can hover over a truncated legend to see the corresponding column name in a tooltip.
* We improved the readability for the smallest size of Liveboard visualizations. Now, minimum-sized visualizations display only the chart, omitting the x- and y-axes and labels. You can hover over select data points to see the values.
