Starting in this release, we have a completely redesigned home page, where you can ask natural-language questions with Sage, view your watchlist, favorites, library of Answers and Liveboards, and more.

The new global navigation organizes ThoughtSpot into different contextual sections designed for the common types of ThoughtSpot users. Within each app, there is left-hand navigation. These different sections are called apps, and you navigate to them using the app switcher image:app_switcher_icon.png[app switcher icon].

// Need new png

You can now conversationally search ThoughtSpot using natural language on a Liveboard visualization, asking follow-up questions for further clarification or to take your analysis in a new direction. This conversational approach allows you to begin with a simple question, and ask successive questions to refine the answer you receive. ThoughtSpot translates each natural language question into a query, and answers in chart format. To enable this feature, contact {support-url}.

// PM: Manan

In addition to using conditional formatting to visually highlight a threshold in a measure (for example, `sales > 10000`), you can now use conditional formatting to compare a column's measures to another column or to a parameter. For example, if you search for `sales this year` compared to `sales last year`, you can highlight where sales this year were less than last year. You can set multiple conditional formatting rules to a single table. To enable this feature, contact your administrator.

A semi-additive measure, also known as snapshot data, is a measure that is usually aggregated for all attributes except for date and time. For certain measures, like inventory, you want to know what the value was at the beginning or end of a period. In that case, you can use the `last_value` function to find the inventory at the end of a month, rather than aggregating all values over the month. Similarly, you can use the `first_value` function to find out your stock at the beginning of a month. To enable this feature, contact your administrator.

=== Demo data publishing on Enterprise Orgs
ThoughtSpot now supports demo data access at the Org level. Customers can leverage this functionality to allow users to try building Answers and Liveboards. This is available to all users in the Org, and users are added to *Demo Data Retail group* by default.
Org administrators can remove users from this group  to remove their access to Demo Data.
