Rather than simply using conditional formatting comparing a column's measures to a single value (for example, `sales > 10000`), you can now use conditional formatting to compare a column's measures to another column or to a parameter. For example, if you search for `sales this year` compared to `sales last year`, you can highlight where sales this year were less than last year. You can set multiple conditional formatting rules to a single table. To enable this feature, contact your administrator.

As an example, you can search for which products are most popular, and use custom sets to define them by sales volume as "gold", "silver", or "bronze" level products.

// Naomi -- SCAL-164290. documentation JIRA SCAL-201306. add what the formula means. add article.

ThoughtSpot now supports the `ts_groups` system variable in Answer and Worksheet formulas. You can use the `ts_groups` variable for data masking, or deciding whether to display the value of a column to a user based on their group membership. For more information, see

endif::[]
ifdef::pendo-links[]
xref:data-masking.adoc[Data masking with system variables,window=_blank].
endif::[]
////
For example, you could create a formula such as: `masked sales = if ( 'all data' in ts_groups) then sales else null`. The formula checks if you are a member of the 'all data' group. If you are a member, the formula returns the sales column. If not, it returns null.
