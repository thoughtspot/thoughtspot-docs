You can create custom sets, which can be used to classify values in a list that you can then reuse across multiple analyses. ThoughtSpot introduces custom column sets in this release. A column set is a custom group of values from a single column. For example, you can use custom sets to define regions with specific countries included or excluded. Custom sets are community objects which remain when you navigate away from the Search Data page and can be used by any user with view access to the underlying Worksheet.

[#9-10-5-cl-ts-groups]
[discrete]
=== Ts_Groups system variable

// Naomi -- SCAL-164290. add what the formula means. add article.
// PM: Damian

ThoughtSpot now supports the `ts_groups` system variable in Answer and Worksheet formulas. You can use the `ts_groups` variable for data masking, or deciding whether to display the value of a column to a user based on their group membership.
////
For example, you could create a formula such as: `masked sales = if ( 'all data' in ts_groups) then sales else null`. The formula checks if you are a member of the 'all data' group. If you are a member, the formula returns the sales column. If not, it returns null.
