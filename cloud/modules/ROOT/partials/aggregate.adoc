[#group_aggregate]
`group_aggregate`
| Takes a measure and optional attributes and filters. Used to aggregate measures with different granularities and filters than the columns used in the search. Commonly used in comparison analysis. +
This formula takes the following form: +
`group_aggregate (<aggregation(measure)>, <groupings>, <filters>)` +
Define lists using curly brackets, `{ }`. Optional list functions `query_groups` or `query_filters` specify the lists or filters used in the original search. Use `+` (plus) and `-` (minus) to add or exclude specific columns for query groups. +
See xref:formulas-aggregation-flexible.adoc[Flexible aggregation functions].
