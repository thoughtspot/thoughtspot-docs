To sync your data, perform these tasks:

== Select application

include::partial$select-applications.adoc[]

== Specify sync schedule

include::partial$schedule.adoc[]

== Map tables

include::partial$map-tables-rest-api.adoc[]

== Map columns

include::partial$map-columns-applications.adoc[]

Note that REST API DataFlow connections support hierarchical data type structures, like arrays.
DataFlow recognizes these complex types, and adds them into  ThoughtSpot as distinct records.

== Set sync properties

=== Basic sync properties

include::partial$sync-properties.adoc[]

=== Scripting for sync

include::partial$sync-scripts.adoc[]

=== Connector-specific sync properties

include::partial$sync-conn-properties.adoc[]
