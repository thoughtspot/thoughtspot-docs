*Delete relationships that have dependents*

You can now delete a join from the ThoughtSpot UI even if the join has dependents. Previously, you had to delete any objects dependent on the join before you could delete the join itself. This change allows you to delete a join and create it again in the other direction, without invalidating or deleting any dependent objects. For more information,
