When you share a Liveboard, you share a live link to the Liveboard that reflects the latest version of it.
When someone else views the Liveboard you shared with them, they see the most recently saved version with the most recent data.

You do not have to be an administrator or the Liveboard's owner to share saved Liveboards.
Any user can share them, based on the access levels the user has.

You can share a Liveboard from the list of Liveboards on <<share-mainliveboardpage,the main Liveboards page>>, or from <<share-liveboardpage,the Liveboard itself>>.

NOTE: This feature is now deprecated. You may not use it starting with release 8.3.0.cl, if you have the new Liveboard experience turned on. For details, see xref:deprecation.adoc[Deprecation Announcements].

You can also share a specific visualization within a Liveboard.
When you share a Liveboard visualization, the user or group receives an email with a link to that visualization.

Note that sharing a specific visualization within a Liveboard gives users and groups access to the entire Liveboard.

. Navigate to the Liveboard visualization that you would like to share.
. In the classic Liveboard experience, select the sharing icon image:icon-share-10px.png[sharing icon] that appears when you hover over the visualization. In the xref:liveboard-experience-new.adoc[new Liveboard experience], select the more menu image:icon-more-10px.png[more menu icon], and select *Copy link*. <<share-liveboardpage,Share the Liveboard>>, and send the link to the specific visualization to the user you want to share it with.
