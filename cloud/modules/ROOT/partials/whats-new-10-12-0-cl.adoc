Spotter can now investigate high-level questions about your data, the same as any human analyst. Spotter deep analysis clarifies any ambiguities in your question, designs an analytical strategy by breaking your question into smaller steps, finds answers to these simpler questions, pulls all the data together in a comprehensive report, and suggests next steps in your analysis.

ThoughtSpot introduces optional grouping columns in query_groups to ensure that only specified columns are included, if they are present in the query. A new syntax allows users to define an explicit optional list of grouping columns. Previously, you needed to manually exclude all other columns from the Model.

Rather than simply training Spotter Coach to recognize search tokens in reference questions, you can now add context, natural language explanations of why those tokens apply to that answer. Adding context to coaching improves performance and makes it easier to tailor Spotter to your data. To enable this feature, contact {support-url}.

=== Last value in period and first value in period functions

// Rani. Jira: SCAL-246727. Docs jira: SCAL-?
// PM: Damian.

We have added support for `last_value_in_period` and `first_value_in_period` functions. These functions are useful for semi-additive measures, measures that typically return a single value per time period rather than being additive across time. For example, if you want to find out the last value for full-time employee headcount for the current date, you can use the formula, `fxFTE = last_value_in_period(sum(full_time_employee), query_groups(), {date})`.

[#10-12-0-cl-multiple]

=== Multiple configurations per connection

// Naomi. jira: SCAL-193108. docs jira: SCAL-?
// PM: Aaghran?

We now support multiple configurations per connection for Snowflake, Databricks, and Google BigQuery. This allows you to allocate a separate warehouse for different ThoughtSpot users or groups, eliminating the need to duplicate Liveboards and configure multiple connections, and helping you with cost tracking and chargeback. You can also use this for your search indexing so that you can control and balance the computing load. In addition, this allows you to easily test a set of Liveboards against different environments (dev, qa, prod), and configure different databases for multi-tenancy / multi-org deployments.
