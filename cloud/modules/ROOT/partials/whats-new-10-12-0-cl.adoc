You can now use natural language instructions to provide global feedback to Spotter that carries over to any query on the underlying data model. To provide natural language instructions, select the instructions icon in Spotter and type a directive about how Spotter is to interpret the question. For example, you can instruct Spotter to specify the date filter as the last 30 days if the user does not provide a date keyword. To enable this feature, contact {support-url}.

The option to exclude cover and filter pages from Liveboard PDFs is now available to all users and on by default. ThoughtSpot Liveboard PDFs include a cover page and filter pages that contain information about the filters applied. You can now use the *PDF Options* checkboxes to choose to include or exclude these page when downloading or scheduling a Liveboard PDF. Cover and filter pages can be excluded for a schedule or download by the user. An administrator can also set cover and filter pages to be included or excluded by default in *Admin settings* under *Downloads & Schedules*.

Optional grouping columns are now available to all users and on by default.

=== Last value in period and first value in period functions

`Last_value_in_period` and `first_value_in_period` functions are now available to all users and on by default. These functions are useful for semi-additive measures, measures that typically return a single value per time period rather than being additive across time. For example, if you want to find out the last value for full-time employee headcount for the current date, you can use the formula, `fxFTE = last_value_in_period(sum(full_time_employee), query_groups(), {date})`.

Rather than simply training Spotter Coach to recognize search tokens in reference questions, you can now add context, natural language explanations of why those tokens apply to that answer. For example, you could add an implicit rule to a sample reference question, clarifying that `sales` should only be calculated on completed transactions.
