Optional grouping columns are now available to all users and on by default. ThoughtSpot supports optional grouping columns in query_groups to ensure that only specified columns are included, if they are present in the query. A new syntax allows users to define an explicit optional list of grouping columns. Previously, you needed to manually exclude all other columns from the Model.

=== Last value in period and first value in period functions

// Rani. Jira: SCAL-246727. Docs jira: SCAL-246727
// PM: Damian.

`Last_value_in_period` and `first_value_in_period` functions are now available to all users and on by default. These functions are useful for semi-additive measures, measures that typically return a single value per time period rather than being additive across time. For example, if you want to find out the last value for full-time employee headcount for the current date, you can use the formula, `fxFTE = last_value_in_period(sum(full_time_employee), query_groups(), {date})`.

Rather than simply training Spotter Coach to recognize search tokens in reference questions, you can now add context, natural language explanations of why those tokens apply to that answer. For example, you could add an implicit rule to a sample reference question, clarifying that `sales` should only be calculated on completed transactions. Adding context to coaching improves accuracy and makes it easier to tailor Spotter to your data. To enable this feature, contact {support-url}.
