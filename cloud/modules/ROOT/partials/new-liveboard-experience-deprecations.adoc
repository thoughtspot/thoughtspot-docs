Liveboard deprecations::
The following features which were available previously in the classic Liveboard experience are *_no longer_* available in a Liveboard.

* *Share a visualization:* The share button for a specific visualization within a Liveboard is no longer available. Instead, share the Liveboard. Then, click the *more* menu image:icon-more-10px.png[more options menu icon] for the visualization, and select *Copy link*. This provides you with a link to the specific visualization within the Liveboard. You can send that link to the user you shared the Liveboard with.
* *Switch between Liveboards from the Liveboard title:* This feature allowed you to select a Liveboard title and view a list of other recently edited Liveboards that you could select. Instead, navigate between Liveboards from your home page, or the Liveboard list page.
* *Copy embed link:* The *Copy embed link* option in the *more* menu image:icon-more-10px.png[more options menu icon] for the Liveboard or a visualization is no longer available. Instead, use the https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/?pageid=visual-embed-sdk[SDK^] for embedding purposes.
* *Change title menu option:* The *Change title* option in the *more* menu image:icon-more-10px.png[more options menu icon] for a visualization is no longer available. Instead, to make changes to the Liveboard, you must be in edit mode. To enter edit mode, select the *Edit* button at the upper right of the Liveboard. Then, select the visualization  title or description to edit it inline.
* *Liveboard edit icon*: The Liveboard edit icon image:icon-edit-10px.png[edit icon image] next to the Liveboard name, for editing the Liveboard name or description, is no longer available. Instead, to make changes to the Liveboard, you must be in edit mode. To enter edit mode, select the *Edit* button at the upper right of the Liveboard. If this button is grayed out, you do not have edit privileges for the Liveboard. To resolve this, contact your administrator or the creator of the Liveboard.
* *Edit an Answer in Liveboard present mode*: This feature allowed users to select the edit icon image:icon-edit-10px.png[edit icon image] while presenting a Liveboard, and directly edit the Answer. Instead, exit *Present* mode, and edit the Answer.
