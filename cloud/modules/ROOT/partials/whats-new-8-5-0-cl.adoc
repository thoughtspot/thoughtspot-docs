You can now make content easily available to your team members when you save or share an answer or Liveboard. Use the *Make this [answer | Liveboard] discoverable* checkbox that appears when you save or share an answer or Liveboard to grant _view_ access to your teammates. Any user who has access to the underlying data source (worksheet, table, view) and is part of the same user group as the author of the content, will be able to  discover and access the answer or Liveboard in *Search Answers*. +
Select this checkbox to publish your content in the list of relevant results when a teammate uses the *Search Answers* feature, or de-select to keep your content private.

[#8-5-0-cl-spotapps]
[discrete]
=== SpotApps

SpotApps are now GA and on by default. SpotApps are ThoughtSpotâ€™s new out-of-the-box solution templates built for specific use cases and data sources. They are built on ThoughtSpot Modeling Language (TML) Blocks, which are pre-built pieces of code that are easy to download and implement directly from the product.

SpotApps mimic the data models of the applications they are based on, such as ServiceNow or Jira. After you connect to your data in your cloud data warehouse, ThoughtSpot maps that data to SpotApp columns, and creates pre-built but still customizable worksheets, answers, and Liveboards, based on your data.

The following SpotApps are now available:

* Databricks Storage Management
* GBQ Performance and Consumption
* Google Analytics
* HubSpot Email Marketing
* Jira Issue Management
* Jira Sprint Management
* Okta Application Management
* Redshift Performance and Consumption
* ServiceNow Incident Management
* Snowflake Performance and Consumption
