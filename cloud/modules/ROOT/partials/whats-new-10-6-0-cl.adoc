Custom comparison points for KPI charts are now on by default and available to all users. Previously, time-series KPI charts had limited options when comparing to past periods. For example, a weekly KPI could be compared against the previous week, the previous month's same week, the previous quarter's same week, or the previous year's same week. Now, you can set a custom point in data against which ThoughtSpot compares the most recent data point, any number of weeks ago. This feature is applicable to all KPIs including time keywords like `weekly`, `monthly`, or `quarterly`.  Your chosen comparison point persists for all viewers of the KPI.

- If none of the data sources used on a Liveboard have Spotter enabled, the *Explore* button appears with a notification indicating Spotter is not available. The user profile setting for Spotter is now removed because Spotter is only shown on Liveboards which have data sources that are enabled sources.
- You can now interact with answers in a Spotter conversation the same way you can with Answers in a Liveboard. You can use Include and Exclude filters, Show underlying data, and chart axis actions like Group axis, Sort, and Filter (provided the chart supports these). Spotter remembers any changes you make when you continue the conversation.

=== Per-Org URLs
ThoughtSpot introduces Org-specific URLs. URLs in emails now include Org context so that users are taken directly to the correct Liveboard in the correct Org even if they belong to multiple Orgs. You can also move between different browser tabs that point to different Orgs.

To enable this feature, contact your administrator.
