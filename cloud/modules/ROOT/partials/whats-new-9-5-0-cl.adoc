[#9-5-0-cl-sage]
[discrete]
=== ThoughtSpot Sage

==== Natural language search enhancements

// Naomi-- check if Sage is GA or EA.

We made the following enhancements to natural language search:

* The following keywords are now supported in natural language search: "vs", "growth of", and "trend".

* ThoughtSpot now stores feedback in order to correctly answer related questions. For example, if you correct the column used in an Answer about annual recurring revenue for 2023, ThoughtSpot uses the correct column in Answers about annual recurring revenue for 2022 and 2021.



[#9-5-0-cl-pivot]
[discrete]
=== Pivot table enhancements

// Naomi

We made the following enhancements to pivot table charts:

- When you download an xlsx version of a pivot table, the measure values are displayed as numbers instead of the general format.
- When you download an xlsx version of a pivot table, row and column labels are shown as separate cells rather than as a column-separated list.
- You can no longer add conditional formatting to a pivot table in heatmap mode.
- Naming of subtotals and grand totals are now consistent in the chart and chart configuration dropdown.
- We now support hyperlinks in pivot tables.
- You can now choose to show or hide row and column summaries and subtotals, from the chart configuration menu. When summaries and subtotals are enabled, you can choose to display them at the top or bottom of the pivot table.

[#9-5-0-cl-date-picker]
[discrete]
=== Date picker GA

// Naomi-- scal-140672

Date picker is now GA and on by default. We added support for rolling, fixed, and custom date filters when creating an Answer or filtering a Liveboard. Previously, when adding a date filter to a Search, ThoughtSpot supported the conditions `ON (=)`, `ON OR AFTER (>=)`, `BEFORE (<)`, and `BETWEEN`. Now, you can additionally filter for `ON OR BEFORE (\<=)`, `NOT BETWEEN`, `ON LAST`, and `ON NEXT`. To try it out, click the filter icon next to the Date column in the left side menu, or click the date filter below the Answer or Liveboard title.

* We have introduced a Watchlist tab on Mobile to make it easier for users to follow important metrics.

Webhooks for Monitor is in beta and off by default. To enable it, contact {support-url}.

// Naomi-- add in a gif showing how to create the filter, then what it looks like to enter a Liveboard with single-select.

When creating a Liveboard, you can now designate attribute filters as single-select, in addition to multi-select. For example, you could choose to make a Country filter single-select, so users would only see data related to one country at a time.
