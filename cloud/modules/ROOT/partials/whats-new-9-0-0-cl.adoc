* ServiceNow
* HubSpot
// combine new sync connectors into one blurb. add link

[discrete]
=== Parameters [.badge.badge-beta]#Beta#
endif::[]

Create Worksheet Parameters to optimize your data inquiries. Use Parameters to run different scenarios with adjustable values, without creating or modifying the constants in formulas for each new value. For example, easily adjust the attribute in an Answer to view your revenue by commit date or order date, as in the following gif.

[#9-0-0-cl-mandatory-filters]
[discrete]
=== Mandatory Liveboard filters

Mark certain filters in your Liveboard as mandatory. If you add mandatory filters to a Liveboard, the visualizations will only load after Liveboard viewers select values for the mandatory filters. Use mandatory filters for Liveboards that contain data that may not be relevant for everyone who must view and consume the Liveboard. Mandatory filters also lower query and performance costs. This feature must be enabled by your administrator.

[#9-0-0-cl-pivot-measures]
[discrete]
=== Show measures in pivot table rows

By default, ThoughtSpot displays measures in columns in pivot tables. With this release, choose whether to display measures in rows or columns in your pivot tables.

[#9-0-0-cl-custom-map]
[discrete]
=== Upload custom geo maps

Upload your own custom maps and visualize data on geo charts with regions that are specific to you and your organization. This feature must be enabled by your administrator.

ifndef::free-trial-feature[]

[#9-0-0-cl-labels]
[discrete]
=== Data labels on a dark background

Labels that appear on a dark background can be displayed in a lighter text color, making them easier to read. This feature must be enabled by your administrator.

[#9-0-0-cl-chinese-traditional]
[discrete]
=== Chinese (Traditional) or 中文 (繁體) localization

Set your ThoughtSpot locale to Chinese (Traditional), or 中文 (繁體). ThoughtSpot changes your data format settings, such as currency and number formatting, and translates keywords, ThoughtSpot menu and navigation items, operators, and error messages. To try it out, navigate to your profile, and edit your system language.

[#9-0-0-cl-rename]
[discrete]
=== Rename Liveboards and visualizations in view mode

Change the name or description of a Liveboard or visualization from view mode. The more
image:icon-more-10px.png[more menu icon]
 menu for Liveboards and Liveboard visualizations now includes a *Rename* option, where you can edit the object name and description.

ifndef::free-trial-feature[]

[#9-0-0-cl-chart-config-apply]
[discrete]
=== Apply multiple chart changes at once

When a user drags and drops the fields in the chart configuration panel, the chart reloads. When a user has multiple fields, they need to rearrange a lot of them to reach a desired chart. Now users can make multiple configurations, and apply them all at once, rather than waiting in between each configuration. This feature must be enabled by your administrator.

// Naomi-- behind a flag

Previously, when using group_aggregate formulas, users could use query_filters to include filters entered in the search bar in the formula's value, but it was difficult to write a formula that accepted filters from only a single column.

Starting with this release, you can specify column names within the ‘filters’ section of a group_aggregate formula, and any filter in your search bar referencing that column will be added to the formula. Filters entered in the search bar that are not on columns specified in the third argument of the group_aggregate formula will be ignored.

// move to bottom of business user

// take example out and make sure the link goes to the example in the article

// remove from free trial. double-check that all beta features are removed from free trial
