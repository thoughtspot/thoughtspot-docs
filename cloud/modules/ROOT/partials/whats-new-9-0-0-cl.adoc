=== ThoughtSpot Sync

// Naomi

You can now use ThoughtSpot Sync to sync data directly from an Answer or custom SQL view to the following apps:

ifndef::pendo-links[]
* xref:sync-hubspot.adoc[HubSpot]
endif::[]
ifdef::pendo-links[]

=== Parameters [.badge.badge-beta]#Beta#
endif::[]

Create Worksheet Parameters to optimize your data inquiries. Use Parameters to run different scenarios with adjustable values, without creating or modifying the constants in formulas for each new value. For example, easily adjust the attribute in an Answer to view your revenue by commit date or order date, as in the following gif. To try it out, edit a Worksheet, and select the *+* button that appears when you hover over the *Parameters* section. For more information about Parameters, see

[#9-0-0-cl-mandatory-filters]
[discrete]
=== Mandatory Liveboard filters

Mark certain filters in your Liveboard as mandatory. If you add mandatory filters to a Liveboard, the visualizations will only load after Liveboard viewers select values for the mandatory filters. Use mandatory filters for Liveboards that contain data that may not be relevant for everyone who must view and consume the Liveboard. Mandatory filters also lower query and performance costs. To try the feature out, select *Mandatory filter* when adding a filter to a Liveboard. This feature must be enabled by your administrator. For more information about mandatory filters, see
ifndef::pendo-links[]
xref:liveboard-filters-mandatory.adoc[Mandatory Liveboard filters].
endif::[]

[#9-0-0-cl-pivot-measures]
[discrete]
=== Show measures in pivot table rows

By default, ThoughtSpot displays measures in columns in pivot tables. With this release, choose whether to display measures in rows or columns in your pivot tables. To try it out, in the chart configuration panel for a pivot table, select *Settings > Display measures in rows*. For more information, see

=== Upload custom geo maps

Upload your own custom maps and visualize data on geo charts with regions that are specific to you and your organization. To try it out, select *Custom maps* in the Admin Console. This feature must be enabled by your administrator. For more information about custom geo maps, see
ifndef::pendo-links[]

[#9-0-0-cl-labels]
[discrete]
=== Data labels on a dark background
Labels that appear on a dark background can be displayed in a lighter text color, making them easier to read. To try it out, navigate to Search data and *Create a chart* > *Change the chart color*, and *Add labels*. This feature must be enabled by your administrator.
For more information,

[#9-0-0-cl-chinese-traditional]
[discrete]
=== Chinese (Traditional) or 中文 (繁體) localization

Set your ThoughtSpot locale to Chinese (Traditional), or 中文 (繁體). ThoughtSpot changes your data format settings, such as currency and number formatting, and translates keywords, ThoughtSpot menu and navigation items, operators, and error messages. To try it out, navigate to your profile, and edit your system language. For more information, see

=== Rename Liveboards and visualizations in view mode

Change the name or description of a Liveboard or visualization from view mode. The more image:icon-more-10px.png[more menu icon] menu for Liveboards and Liveboard visualizations now includes a *Rename* option, where you can edit the object name and description. To try it out, navigate to a Liveboard, and select the more image:icon-more-10px.png[more menu icon] menu for a visualization. For more information, see

[#9-0-0-cl-chart-config-apply]
[discrete]
=== Apply multiple chart changes at once
When a user drags and drops the fields in the chart configuration panel, the chart reloads. When a user has multiple fields, they need to rearrange a lot of them to reach a desired chart. Now users can make multiple configurations, and apply them all at once, rather than waiting in between each configuration. To try it out, click *Apply* in the chart configuration panel after editing a chart.

This feature must be enabled by your administrator.
For more information, see
ifndef::pendo-links[]
xref:chart-x-axis.adoc[Reorder labels on the axis or legend].
endif::[]
ifdef::pendo-links[]
xref:chart-x-axis.adoc[Reorder labels on the axis or legend,window=_blank].

endif::free-trial-feature[]

// Yochana. early access  updated the blurb as per review

// rename to "apply multiple changes at once" or similar. a little bit of language reworking and more clarity (moves a field). chart configuration panel, not config. don't specify the wait time from before. specify that you can make multiple configurations and then apply them rather than waiting in between each configuration. no need to mention resetting (the point is the apply button)

=== Group aggregation enhancements: filters [.badge.badge-beta]#Beta#
endif::[]
// Naomi-- behind a flag

Previously, when using group_aggregate formulas, users could use query_filters to include filters entered in the search bar in the formula's value, but it was difficult to write a formula that accepted filters from only a single column.

Starting with this release, you can specify column names within the ‘filters’ section of a group_aggregate formula, and any filter in your search bar referencing that column will be added to the formula. Filters entered in the search bar that are not on columns specified in the third argument of the group_aggregate formula will be ignored. For details, see
ifndef::pendo-links[]
xref:formulas-aggregation-flexible.adoc#groupagg-filters-enhancement[Group aggregation filters].

[#9-0-0-cl-snowflake-csv]

=== Snowflake CSV upload
Snowflake CSV upload is GA in this release. Now you have a quick and easy way to complete one-time data loads of small files that are not present in your cloud data warehouse. You can now upload a CSV file to the database of your Snowflake connection that can be joined to other tables or Worksheets in your connection. Once your administrator enables this feature, go to *Data* > *Utilities*, and click *Upload CSV*.

[#9-0-0-cl-dbt-meta]
[discrete]
=== dbt metadata tags for tables and Worksheets

Manage your ThoughtSpot table and Worksheet column properties and table joins in dbt by using metadata tags to define column properties and joins within your dbt model schema. Your dbt models contain all the necessary information, and you don't have to manually update the columns in ThoughtSpot when you make changes to your dbt model. To try it out, update the `.yml` schema files for your dbt models with the new metadata tags. For more information, see
