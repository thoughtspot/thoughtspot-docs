We have added support for `last_value_in_period` and `first_value_in_period` functions. These functions are useful for semi-additive measures, measures that typically return a single value per time period rather than being additive across time. For example, if you want to find out the last value for full-time employee headcount for the current date, you can use the formula, `fxFTE = last_value_in_period(sum(full_time_employee), query_groups(), {date})`.
