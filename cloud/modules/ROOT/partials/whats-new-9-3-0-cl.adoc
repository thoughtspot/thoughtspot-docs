=== ThoughtSpot Sage
endif::[]

In this release, ThoughtSpot Sage features are available for administrators to enable, without contacting ThoughtSpot Support. ThoughtSpot Sage makes it easier for you to get answers and insights from your complex data. ThoughtSpot Sage uses  a combination of GPT-3, GPT-3.5T and GPT-4, and the large language models (LLM) of the Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service.

Sage features include:

- Natural language search
- AI-suggested searches
- AI-generated Worksheet column synonyms
Sage features are disabled by default and available for administrators to enable in the Admin Console.

Once enabled, your ThoughtSpot administrator can grant access to the *Natural language search* and *AI-suggested searches* features for users in a group by assigning the *_Can preview ThoughtSpot Sage_* user privilege to the group. You do not need this privilege to access AI-generated Worksheet column synonyms.

The AI-suggested searches feature is now available for administrators to enable, without contacting ThoughtSpot Support. This feature helps you think of relevant questions to ask of your own data source, by providing examples of searches. This feature is designed to help you get started if you are a new user of Search Data, or if you are working with a new Worksheet. This feature must be enabled by your administrator.

=== ThoughtSpot Cloud on Google Cloud


//Naomi

ThoughtSpot Cloud will be available on Google Cloud Platform in addition to AWS. Customers can choose whether they want their SaaS deployed on AWS or GCP.

ThoughtSpot on GCP can be purchased directly from ThoughtSpot but will also be available to purchase in the Google Cloud Marketplace, the BigQuery Partner Center, and Google Workspace Marketplace. Customers can also use their committed spend and credits on Google Marketplace to purchase ThoughtSpot. To migrate to GCP, contact {support-url}.

=== Liveboard cross filters

Liveboard cross filters are now GA. Right-click any data point in your Liveboard and easily filter the entire Liveboard by that value. For example, if you right-click *California* in a geo chart on your Liveboard, and then select *Filter*, all the other visualizations only show data from California. A visualization for *Total sales by city*, for example, would only show sales for cities in California. This feature is also called _brushing and linking_.

=== Liveboard note tiles

The Liveboard note tiles feature is now GA. Add notes to your Liveboards, so that viewers of your Liveboards can quickly understand how to use the data and visualizations you gathered. Note tiles can provide an overview of a Liveboard or visualization, company branding through images, definitions of terms used in the Liveboard, and so on.

=== Change the filter order for Answer filters

Arrange Answer filters in the filter bar so that they are in a logical, coherent order, by dragging and dropping them to different spots in the list. This makes it easier for viewers of the Answer to understand and use the filters on the Answer.

=== Keywords "of","percentage of"

// Naomi

To enable business users to answer questions related to mix, contribution, share of, percentage, and total ratios, we added the keywords “of” and “percentage of”. These keywords help answer questions such as “What is the share of a certain store’s sales as a percentage of the regional whole?” Previously, searches such as these required the use of a group aggregate formula, which presented a barrier to users. To try out this feature, enter a search phrase in the search bar containing the keyword, such as `sales percentage of store region`, and press *Go*.

=== Liveboard header visible when you scroll down

When you scroll down in a Liveboard, the Liveboard name, menu options, and filter and tab bars remain visible. You don't need to scroll back up to the top to edit the Liveboard or check if you're filtering by a specific store. You can see the filters or parameters applied to the Liveboard, select the *Edit* button or more options image:icon-more-10px.png[more options menu icon] menu, and view which tab you're on from any spot in the Liveboard.

=== Ability to change legend position

// Naomi

You can now configure the legend position of a chart, or hide the legend. The available options are left, right, above, and below the visualization. To try it out, open the chart configuration menu, select *Settings*, and choose between *Legend on right*, *Legend on left*, *Legend on top*, and *Legend on bottom*. You can select the *Show legend* toggle to hide or show the legend.

=== Date picker enhancement in Search

// Naomi

We added support for rolling, fixed, and custom date filters when creating an Answer. Previously, when adding a date filter to a Search, ThoughtSpot supported the conditions `ON (=)`, `ON OR AFTER (>=)`, `BEFORE (<)`, and `BETWEEN`. Now, you can additionally filter for `ON OR BEFORE (\<=)`, `NOT BETWEEN`, `ON LAST`, and `ON NEXT`. To try it out, click the filter icon next to the Date column in the left side menu, or click the date filter below the Answer title.

[#9-3-0-cl-group-agg-correct]
[discrete]
=== Group aggregate enhancements: reaggregation

// Naomi

To reduce confusion when using aggregate formulas, the level of detail defined in group formulas is now respected at query level. For example, when trying to calculate the contribution of each store’s sales to the entire region, you might use a group_sum formula, where the sales at store level is divided by the sales at regional level. Your search would include the following columns: `Revenue`, `Customer nation`, `Regional Revenue formula`, and `Customer region`, where `Regional Revenue formula =  group_sum(Revenue, Customer Region)`.

According to the old reaggregation behavior, if a customer removed `Customer region` from the search bar, the level of detail in the formula would no longer be respected and the formula’s denominator would re-aggregate up to the total. In this case, the formula result would display revenue as a percentage of total revenue, rather than as a percentage of regional revenue.

Under the new aggregation behavior, the formula result will continue to display revenue as a percentage of each region, even if you remove `Customer region` from the search bar. Visualizations will also display the correct aggregation even if the grouping column is not added to the X-axis.

=== AI-generated Worksheet column synonyms
endif::[]

When you create a Worksheet, ThoughtSpot automatically creates synonyms for each column name. This feature is now available for administrators to enable, without contacting ThoughtSpot Support. Users can easily start searching on your data, without knowing the exact names for every column. For example, if you have a column named `Product type`, ThoughtSpot might create a synonym such as `Product Category`. When a user searches for revenue by product category, for example, ThoughtSpot returns sales by product type.

=== Specify default connection for CSV uploads

// Naomi

Previously, when multiple database connections were configured to receive CSV uploads without a specified table or worksheet for collocation, the files were randomly uploaded to one of the connections. With this new enhancement, administrators and data managers now have the ability to specify a default target connection for such uploads.

To set the default target connection, navigate to *Data > Connections* and use the new CSV Upload Default toggle. By specifying a default connection, you ensure that CSV files without a designated destination will be uploaded to the chosen connection.
This enhancement provides better control and organization of CSV uploads, making it easier to manage data in scenarios where end-users do not select a collocation for their uploaded files.
