=== ThoughtSpot Sage
endif::[]

In this release, ThoughtSpot Sage features are available for administrators to enable, without contacting ThoughtSpot Support. ThoughtSpot Sage makes it easier for you to get answers and insights from your complex data. ThoughtSpot Sage uses  a combination of GPT-3, GPT-3.5T and GPT-4, and the large language models (LLM) of the Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service.

Sage features include:

- Natural language search
- AI-suggested searches
- AI-generated Worksheet column synonyms

Sage features are disabled by default and available for administrators to enable in the Admin Console.

Once enabled, your ThoughtSpot administrator can grant access to the *Natural language search* and *AI-suggested searches* features for users in a group by assigning the *_Can preview ThoughtSpot Sage_* user privilege to the group. You do not need this privilege to access AI-generated Worksheet column synonyms. For more information about ThoughtSpot Sage,

=== ThoughtSpot Cloud on Google Cloud

//Naomi

ThoughtSpot Cloud will be available on Google Cloud Platform in addition to AWS. Customers can choose whether they want their SaaS deployed on AWS or GCP.

ThoughtSpot on GCP can be purchased directly from ThoughtSpot but will also be available to purchase in the Google Cloud Marketplace, the BigQuery Partner Center, and Google Workspace Marketplace.

=== Liveboard cross filters

Liveboard cross filters are now GA. Right-click any data point in your Liveboard and easily filter the entire Liveboard by that value. For example, if you right-click *California* in a geo chart on your Liveboard, and then select *Filter*, all the other visualizations only show data from California. A visualization for *Total sales by city*, for example, would only show sales for cities in California. This feature is also called _brushing and linking_. To try it out, select any data point(s) in a Liveboard visualization, and select *Filter* from the menu that appears. For more information, see

Note tiles can provide an overview of a Liveboard or visualization, company branding through images, definitions of terms used in the Liveboard, and so on. With the GA of the note tiles feature, you don't need a specific privilege to upload images. To try it out, edit a Liveboard, and select *Add note*. For more information, see

// Naomi

To enable business users to answer questions related to mix, contribution, share of, percentage, and total ratios, we added the keywords “of” and “percentage of”. These keywords help answer questions such as “What is the share of a certain store’s sales as a percentage of the regional whole?” Previously, searches such as these required the use of a group aggregate formula, which presented a barrier to users. To try out this feature, enter a search phrase in the search bar containing the keyword, such as `sales percentage of store region`, and press *Go*.

To try it out, open any Liveboard, and scroll down.

Now, you can additionally filter for `ON OR BEFORE (\<=)`, `NOT BETWEEN`, `ON LAST`, and `ON NEXT`. To try it out, click the filter icon next to the Date column in the left side menu, or click the date filter below the Answer or Liveboard title. For more information, see

=== AI-generated Worksheet column synonyms
endif::[]

When you create a Worksheet, ThoughtSpot automatically creates synonyms for each column name. This feature is now available for administrators to enable, without contacting ThoughtSpot Support. Users can easily start searching on your data, without knowing the exact names for every column. For example, if you have a column named `Product type`, ThoughtSpot might create a synonym such as `Product Category`. When a user searches for revenue by product category, for example, ThoughtSpot returns sales by product type. To try it out, create and save a new Worksheet. Your column name synonyms appear in the *Synonyms* column on the Worksheet details page. This feature must be enabled by your administrator.

[#9-3-0-cl-csv-connection]

=== Specify default connection for CSV uploads

// Naomi


Previously, when multiple database connections were configured to receive CSV uploads without a specified table or worksheet for collocation, the files were randomly uploaded to one of the connections. With this new enhancement, administrators and data managers now have the ability to specify a default target connection for such uploads.

To set the default target connection, navigate to *Data > Connections*, click the *More* menu icon image:icon-more-10px.png[menu icon], select *Configure data upload*, and click the *Enable data upload* toggle to on. Next, select the *Set as default CSV upload destination* toggle. By specifying a default connection, you ensure that CSV files without a designated destination will be uploaded to the chosen connection.
This enhancement provides better control and organization of CSV uploads, making it easier to manage data in scenarios where end-users do not select a collocation for their uploaded files.
