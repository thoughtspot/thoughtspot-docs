Answer experience deprecations::
The following features which were available previously in the classic Answer experience are *_no longer_* available in an Answer.

* *Browser back button:* you can no longer use the browser back button to go back one step in a search or saved Answer. Instead, use the new in-product back button to the right of the search bar in a search or saved Answer.
* *Multiple join path resolution within the formula editor or a search:* when you try to search on columns with more than one possible join path, the system no longer allows you to define the join path within the search.
Similarly, when you try to create a formula with columns with more than one possible join path, the system does not allow you to define the join path.
Instead, the system now prompts you to resolve this issue and avoid confusion or incorrect data by creating a Worksheet with the correct join path.
* *Send feedback:* The option to send product feedback, from the *more options* menu image:icon-more-10px.png[more options menu icon] on an Answer or search.
* *Client-side summaries for tables:* We consolidated column summaries and headlines into one summary, called a headline summary. To calculate these headline summaries, ThoughtSpot executes one SQL query for each summary against the underlying database.
These headline summaries are integrated with the table columns.
You can pin them to Liveboards, but you must manually re-enable headline summaries on charts and tables in your Liveboards from the chart or table settings. ThoughtSpot won't migrate them automatically, because of high query costs.
* *Granular access to Liveboards:* A privilege limiting some users to *Read only* access on curated Liveboards. These users could view and explore; however, they could not copy, alter, download, or share the Liveboards.
