You can now use SpotIQ analysis to directly identify the key drivers for recent change in your KPIs. KPI change analysis allows you to drill down into the causes of change in your KPIs and customize the insights generated by SpotIQ.

To access this feature, go to your KPI chart and select the caret icon to the right of the percent change label. The *Run change analysis* pop-up allows you to customize the columns ThoughtSpot analyzes. Note that ThoughtSpot runs change analysis between the two most recent data points defined by the KPIâ€™s time bucket (for example, `daily` or `weekly`).

[#8-8-0-cl-piecewise-group-aggregate]
[discrete]
=== Headline summaries for discontinuous group aggregate formulas

// Naomi

We changed the default behavior for table aggregation summaries when the search contains a formulas that contain both a conditional clause (`if... then... else`) and a group_aggregate expression. When a user searches with a formula containing both a conditional clause and a group_aggregate expression, then ThoughtSpot detects the aggregation type on the first non-constant output clause and uses it in the headline summary. In this context, a non-constant output clause means any base column reference (for example, `Revenue`), or formula (for example, `sum(revenue)`).

For example, in the formula `group_aggregate(sum(if (Color = 'blue') then 0 else group_unique_count(Discount)))`, the headline summary would use `COUNT_DISTINCT`, since the first non-constant output clause within the `if... then... else` clause is `group_unique_count` and has an aggregation type of `COUNT_DISTINCT`.
