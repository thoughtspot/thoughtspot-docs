You can now use SpotIQ analysis to directly identify the key drivers for recent change in your KPIs. To access this feature, go to your KPI chart and select the caret icon to the right of the percent change label. The *Run change analysis* pop-up allows you to customize the columns ThoughtSpot analyzes. Note that ThoughtSpot runs change analysis between the two most recent data points defined by the KPIâ€™s time bucket (for example, `daily` or `weekly`).

[#8-8-0-cl-underlying-data]

=== Show underlying data user experience improvements

// Naomi

We made the following improvements to the Show underlying data user interface:

* When you right-click a table and select *Show underlying data*, ThoughtSpot displays only the visualized columns from your search.
* You can now open the *Show underlying data* pop-up and click *Edit columns* to add or remove columns from your query.
* When you open the *Edit columns* pop-up, you can now search for column names using the search bar.
* The *Show underlying data* pop-up no longer disables columns by default. To disable columns from your query, click *Edit columns* and deselect the column name(s).

[#8-8-0-cl-year-name]
[discrete]
=== year_name function

The new `year_name` formula function returns the year in string format for a given date. This improves the behavior of formulas involving years when using a custom calendar with year values that are not in integer format.

[#8-8-0-cl-piecewise-group-aggregate]
[discrete]
=== Headline summaries for discontinuous group aggregate formulas

// Naomi

We changed the default behavior for table aggregation summaries when the search contains a formulas that contain both a conditional clause (`if... then... else`) and a group_aggregate expression. When a user searches with a formula containing both a conditional clause and a group_aggregate expression, then ThoughtSpot detects the aggregation type on the first non-constant output clause and uses it in the headline summary. In this context, a non-constant output clause means any base column reference (for example, `Revenue`), or formula (for example, `sum(revenue)`).

For example, in the formula `group_aggregate(sum(if (Color = 'blue') then 0 else group_unique_count(Discount)))`, the headline summary would use `COUNT_DISTINCT`, since the first non-constant output clause within the `if... then... else` clause is `group_unique_count` and has an aggregation type of `COUNT_DISTINCT`.
