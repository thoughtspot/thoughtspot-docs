=== Mobile enhancements

// Naomi and Mary--scal-159581, scal-95381, scal-158204

We made the following improvements to ThoughtSpot mobile:

* We simplified the log in process for the ThoughtSpot mobile app. You can now enter your company email to receive an email with a magic link login, rather than entering the server URL.
* You can now change your ThoughtSpot locale through the Mobile app. When your locale is updated, ThoughtSpot translates labels, date formats and number formats to match the default for your country and language.
* You can now use SpotIQ analysis to directly identify the key drivers for recent change in your KPIs in ThoughtSpot Mobile. KPI change analysis allows you to drill down into the causes of change in your KPIs and customize the insights generated by SpotIQ.

=== Personalized Liveboard Views [.badge.badge-early-access-whats-new]#Early Access#
endif::[]
Personalized views allow you to save your own set of values for filters and parameters in a Liveboard without editing the original Liveboard. You can change the values of the already present filters and parameters in a Liveboard and save it for future use. The new Liveboard is version of the master Liveboard, so any changes made to the master Liveboard are carried over ot the new Liveboard. This includes changes made to pinned visualizations, tabs, filter chips, and re-ordering. Changes made to the new Liveboard are not automatically pushed to the master Liveboard.

// Mary-- note: this article should be titled personalized-liveboard-views.adoc to match in-product links. Add an image with a box around the filter line with the saved filters.
