=== Mobile enhancements

// Naomi and Mary--scal-159581, scal-95381, scal-158204

We made the following improvements to ThoughtSpot mobile:

* We simplified the log in process for the ThoughtSpot mobile app. You can now enter your company email to receive an email with a magic link login, rather than entering the server URL.
* You can now change your ThoughtSpot locale through the Mobile app. When your locale is updated, ThoughtSpot translates labels, date formats and number formats to match the default for your country and language.
* You can now use SpotIQ analysis to directly identify the key drivers for recent change in your KPIs in ThoughtSpot Mobile. KPI change analysis allows you to drill down into the causes of change in your KPIs and customize the insights generated by SpotIQ.

=== Personalized Liveboard Views [.badge.badge-early-access-whats-new]#Early Access#

Personalized Liveboard views allow you to save your own set of values for filters and parameters in a Liveboard without creating a copy of the Liveboard. When you change the values of the already present filters in a Liveboard, you can save the personalized view for future use. The personalized Liveboard view inherits any changes made to the master Liveboard, including changes made to pinned visualizations, tabs, filter chips, and re-ordering.

// Naomi-- scal-165262

Embedding in note tiles is now GA. You can now embed interactive content such as videos, pdfs, or Figma files into Liveboards using the note tile format. To try it out, enter a Liveboard, select the edit icon, and select *Add note* from the top bar. You can then click the embed icon and enter the URL or iFrame code for your content. You can interact with the content embedded in a Liveboard like you would with a website.

=== System Variables in Answer and Worksheet formulas

// Naomi-- more details on use case. reword to be clearer. clarify if new variables can be used in row-level security.-- scal-139891

Previously, ThoughtSpot supported the `ts_username` variable for use in row-level security formulas alone. Now, users can access the following string variables:

* `ts_orgname`
* `ts_email_domain`

`ts_orgname`, `ts_username`, and `ts_email_domain` variables are available to use in Answer and Worksheet formulas.

When creating a filter on a Liveboard or Answer, you must have access to the underlying data source. Users can now request access to the underlying Worksheet through the filter modal on a Liveboard or Answer.
