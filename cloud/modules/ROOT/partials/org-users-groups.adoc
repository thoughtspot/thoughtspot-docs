On a multi-tenant instance, the cluster and Org administrators can create and administer users and groups. The cluster administrator can perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operations on user and group objects of all Orgs, whereas the Org administrator can create and administer users and groups only in the Org context to which they belong.

[NOTE]
====
To manage Org groups, the cluster administrator must switch to the appropriate Org. This includes management of the groups a specific user belongs to. To manage Org users, the cluster administrator can be in the primary Org or the specific Org the user belongs to.

You should only use the *All orgs > Users* section of the Admin Console to add users to multiple Orgs. Use the individual Org's *Admin Console > Users* section to add users to individual Orgs, and to add users to groups.
