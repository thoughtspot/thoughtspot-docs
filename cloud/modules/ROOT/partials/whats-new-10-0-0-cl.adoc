// PM: Manan

In addition to using conditional formatting to visually highlight a threshold in a measure (for example, `sales > 10000`), you can now use conditional formatting to compare a column's measures to another column.
//or to a parameter.
For example, if you search for `sales this year` compared to `sales last year`, you can highlight where sales this year were less than last year. You can set multiple conditional formatting rules to a single table. To enable this feature, contact your administrator.
