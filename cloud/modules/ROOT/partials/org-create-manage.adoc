[#create-manage]
== Create and manage Orgs

To create an Org on a multi-tenant ThoughtSpot instance, you need cluster administrator privileges. By default, the administrator of the Primary Org is a cluster administrator. The cluster administrator can create Orgs using either the UI or the REST v1 API endpoints. In this section, you can learn how to <<create-orgs,create>>, <<edit-orgs,edit>>, and <<delete-orgs,delete>> Orgs.

To create Orgs using the REST v1 API endpoints, refer to https://visual-embed-sdk-beta-docs.vercel.app/docs/?pageid=orgs-api[Orgs API^].

NOTE: When you delete an Org, you delete all its users and all objects they created. However, if a user in the deleted Org also exists in an Org you did not delete, ThoughtSpot deletes all the user objects in the deleted Org, but that user continues to exist in the other Org. ThoughtSpot completely deletes all objects existing in the deleted Org. These objects cannot be retrieved later.
