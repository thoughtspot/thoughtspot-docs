In this release, you can try our redesigned and customizable home page, where you can ask natural-language questions with Sage, view your watchlist, favorites, library of Answers and Liveboards, and more. With the new left-hand navigation, you can go directly to your Liveboards, Answers, SpotIQ Analysis, and Monitor Subscriptions.

This new home page experience is disabled by default. Contact your ThoughtSpot administrator to enable this feature for your cluster. After that, open your user profile, and in the _Experience_ section, set the _Navigation and Homepage_ to *New experience*. Note that this setting also enables persona-based navigation.

In this release, you can try our completely redesigned navigation experience organized by persona. The new app switcher allows business users, analysts, data engineers, administrators, and developers to work in separate contextual sections designed specifically for their needs. In addition, each app has left-hand navigation to create better consistency and ease of use for users switching between the different apps.

=== Drill down in change analysis

// Naomi – SCAL-180942. doc: SCAL-205576 (approved)
// PM: Vikas

Drill down in change analysis is now on by default and available to all users. You can now drill down on specific columns in change analysis, in order to identify change drivers within your data. For example, if you run an analysis on sales monthly and find out that the 'jacket' item type changed the most, you can easily drill down on jacket sales and identify which region contributed the most to the change in sales.

You can create query sets, which can be used to classify values in a list that you can then reuse across multiple analyses. A query set is a custom group of values from a collection of objects in your database.
Query sets are community objects which remain when you navigate away from the *Search Data* page and can be used by any user with view access to the underlying Worksheet. To enable this feature, contact {support-url}.

=== Sage Coach enhancements

// Naomi. epic: SCAL-194540. doc: SCAL-209711
// PM: Alok, Anant

We made the following changes to Sage Coach:

* Only users with Worksheet editing rights can promote feedback to the global access level so that it applies user queries on the Worksheet.
* Once feedback is promoted to global access level, users without worksheet editing access cannot take any actions on it. For more information on the changes in the permission model, refer to
ifndef::pendo-links[]
xref:sage-coach.adoc#permissions[Sage Coach permissions].
endif::[]
ifdef::pendo-links[]
xref:sage-coach.adoc#permissions[Sage Coach permissions,window=_blank].
endif::[]
* When a Worksheet column is modified, such as a column name change, the changes are reflected in Sage Coach feedback. When a column is deleted, any feedback using that column is also removed. While saving a changed Worksheet, you have the option to review the impacted feedback, ensuring accurate updates upon confirmation.
* You can now edit query fragment text before submitting feedback. Additionally, you can edit the natural language query terms along with the Answer tokens through the Sage Coach flow.
