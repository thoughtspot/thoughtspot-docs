=== Alerts by attribute

// Naomi â€“ jira: SCAL-244702. docs jira: SCAL-258659
// PM: Rahul PJP

Alerts by attribute are now available to all users and on by default. Alerts by attribute are now on by default and available to all users. You can now set KPI alerts to trigger when a selected attribute changes. This can include changes in the value of the attribute, such as an increase in sales by percentage by state, or a scheduled alert to trigger on a weekly basis.

For example, if you wanted to create an alert for a KPI tracking sales of different phones by brand, you could choose the intended brands as attributes and set an alert to be notified when sales for those specific brands dropped by 5%.
