When you want to investigate further on a chart in Spotter, you can now ask direct questions like, "Why did my sales drop last month?" or "Why did sales drop in Q2?" Spotter identifies the key attributes and leverages the change analysis engine to provide a clear, natural language summary identifying the key drivers, supported by detailed visualizations. To enable this feature, contact your administrator.

When viewing a Liveboard, you can now filter columns from the Worksheet or Model you have access to. When viewing a Liveboard with a Worksheet or Model that you don't have access to, you can see parameters and filters, but they are read-only and you can't re-order them. When a Worksheet or Model has a hidden column as a filter, you can select it but it only shows the selected values and you can't change the values.

When editing a Liveboard, you can now add, edit, and remove filters and parameters from a Worksheet or Model you have access to, but you can't link filters to a Worksheet or Model that you don’t have access to.

=== Show only relevant filters and parameters on Liveboards
This feature is now on by default and available to all users. Filters and parameters that are not relevant to a tab are hidden by default when you open and view a Liveboard. You can choose to view all filters and parameters, including those that are not relevant to the tab, so that you can quickly create a new View or download the Liveboard without having to switch tabs and apply filters individually.
//The option to expand and view filters and parameters is only available when there are hidden filters and parameters on the tab.
