We're excited to introduce the "Answering Why" capability in Spotter! When you see a metric change on a simple chart, you can now ask direct questions like, "Why did my sales drop last month?" or "Why did sales drop in Q2?" Spotter identifies the key attributes and leverages the change analysis engine to provide a clear, natural language summary identifying the key drivers, supported by detailed visualizations. This the first step in enabling Spotter to answer "why" questions. To enable this feature, contact your administrator.

You can now run change analysis on KPIs that display a single point of data, such as `Sales` or `Sales today`. This new aggregated KPI chart also displays percentage change from the last period defined in the aggregation. For example, if the date bucket is daily, a KPI might display a 5% change from yesterday below the displayed number. To enable this feature, contact {support-url}.
