We're excited to introduce the "Answering Why" capability in Spotter! When you see a metric change on a simple chart, you can now ask direct questions like, "Why did my sales drop last month?" or "Why did sales drop in Q2?" Spotter identifies the key attributes and leverages the change analysis engine to provide a clear, natural language summary identifying the key drivers, supported by detailed visualizations. This the first step in enabling Spotter to answer "why" questions. To enable this feature, contact your administrator.

In this release, you can now use any parameter from an axis or column name of a chart in the title or description of the Answer which contains that chart. A parameter used in the title or description always displays the value of the same parameter used in the chart itself.

When a Liveboard has one Worksheet/Model and the user does not read/write access to it,
parameters and filters are read only. When a Liveboard has more than one Worksheet/Model and the user has read/write access to at least one Worksheet/Model, filters columns from a Worksheet/Model with access should be interactable in the view mode. If the filter is a linked filter to a filter from a different WS without access, even then it should be interactable
Filter columns from WS without access continue to be read-only
Parameters from WS without access should be read-only similar to how the filters on WS without access are read only.
When the user has edit access to the Liveboard but not to the Worksheet/Model, they cannot re-order the filters and parameters

You can now run change analysis on KPIs that display a single point of data, such as `Sales` or `Sales today`. This new aggregated KPI chart also displays percentage change from the last period defined in the aggregation. For example, if the date bucket is daily, a KPI might display a 5% change from yesterday below the displayed number. To enable this feature, contact {support-url}.
