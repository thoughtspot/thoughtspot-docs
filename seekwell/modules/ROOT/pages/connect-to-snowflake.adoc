== Prerequisites

To connect to *Snowflake* with *{seekwell}*, you need the following fields:

* Account Name

* Schema (optional)

To find these values in a Snowflake worksheet, first check the URL.

In the URL, you will find your Account Name (`abcd1234` in our example) and your Region (`us-east-1`). If you don't see a region, it means you're in the default region of `us-west-1`.

----
jdbc:snowflake://xy12345.eu-central-1.snowflakecomputing.com/?user=peter&warehouse=mywh&db=mydb&schema=public

In the example above:

* *Account Name* = xy12345
* *Region* = eu-central-1
** (if region is missing, it means your region is `us-west-1`)
* *Username* = peter
* *Warehouse* = mywh

* *Schema* = public
