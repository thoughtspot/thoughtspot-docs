You can query live Salesforce data with {seekwell}. We use link:https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.soql_sosl.meta/soql_sosl/sforce_api_calls_soql.htm[SOQL,window=_blank], the Salesforce query language, to execute the statements.

To set up Salesforce as your source, follow these steps:

. Select *Salesforce* as the *Source* in the top right. If you don't see Salesforce as an option, authorize the app link:https://login.salesforce.com/[here,window=_blank] and reload {seekwell}.

. A schema appears in the right with the Salesforce Object names. If you select one object, you will see all the fields / columns available in that Object. Select the "back" button to go back to the Objects.
