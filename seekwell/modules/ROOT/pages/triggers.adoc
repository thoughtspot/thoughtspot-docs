You can use *Triggers* (or conditions) to prevent the execution of a scheduled job. For example, if you had a query that was scheduled to run every 5 minutes and send an email, you could add a trigger that must be met before the email is actually sent. There are three types of triggers:

* "Block has rows" checks if another block is currently returning rows.

* "Block value changed" will check if one of the columns in another block has changed since the last run.

* "Block value changed by..." allows you to define a custom link:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Conditional_Operator[JavaScript Conditional (ternary) operator,window=_blank]. The current and previous results are available to the operator as `cur` and `prev`.

For example, if you had a column in the trigger block called "users" and you wanted to check if users increased 10% since the last run, you could use the ternary:

----
cur.users > prev.users * 1.1 ? true : false
----

NOTE: You can only use blocks that are titled and return exactly one row for the "trigger block".
