// More

{seekwell} Forms allow you to expose SQL statements as Forms to non-technical teammates. Team members are able to execute pre-defined SQL statements without any SQL experience. Simply set up xref:parameters.adoc[⚙ Parameters] for a query and share the link to the form with your team.

NOTE: {seekwell} does no manipulation on your SQL statements to prevent SQL injection. Do not expose blocks or forms to untrusted users. You should prefer xref:parameters.adoc[Selects] over Value parameter types and use xref:forms.adoc#approval-queues[Approval Queues] and xref:forms.adoc#lookups[Lookups,window=_blank] where appropriate.

. Create a new block and add at least one xref:parameters.adoc[⚙ Parameter].

. Test the SQL statement and ensure results are as expected.

. To view the block as a form, select kbd:[`command`] / kbd:[`control`] + kbd:[`k`] and search for "Go to Form".

. Test the Form again with new inputs.

NOTE: Only admin users can see the SQL preview and edit the block.

. To share the form with your team, copy the URL.

. You can also set defaults in the URL with xref:parameters.adoc#url-parameters[URL parameters].

[#approval-queues]
== Approval Queues

You can require Form submissions to be approved by an admin on your team. When creating the Form, select "Requires approval" from the drop-down on the left. Admins can approve submission from the queue by changing the status to "Approved".

[#lookups]
== Lookups

If you use a "lookup" field in the form, the user will be prompted for that value before being able to submit. Once the user provides a value for the lookup field, the "Lookup Block" will run and populate any matching values in the Forms parameters.

. Select "Add Lookup" under Parameters.

. Select the field in the Form you want to use to look up values in the "Lookup Block".
+
image:lookup-values.png[Select the field to use for look up values]

. Select the field in the "Lookup Block".

. Select the name of the field in the "Lookup Block" that matches the "Form Block".

For example, if you create a Lookup Block of:

[source]
----
select column_one, column_two
from table_name
where column_three = '{{column_three}}'
----

And your form has the following parameters:

* column_one
* column_two
* column_three (lookup field)

Then, when the user submits a lookup on column_three, both column_one and column_two will be populated with current values from the Lookup Block.
