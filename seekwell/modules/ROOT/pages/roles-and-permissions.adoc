Team administrators can manage what functionality other users can access by selecting kbd:[`command`] / kbd:[`control`] + kbd:[`k`], and searching for "Roles". The following roles are available:

Admin:: Full access to the app including administrative features.

User:: Full access to the app excluding administrative features.

Restricted:: Allows administrator to select functionality / permissions individually.

To grant specific functionality to a restricted user, type the desired permissions into the "Permissions" field that appears when you select "Restricted" from the role drop-down menu:

sql.view:: Ability to view SQL on `/run` in the app.

sql.run:: Ability to run SQL on `/run` in the app.

blocks.all:: Access to *all* blocks.

blocks.tagged:: Access only to blocks marked by certain tags (see xref:tags-and-search.adoc[#Ô∏è‚É£ Tags and Search]). Use the _tag.[tagname]_ permissions to control which blocks the user can see.
