:description: Set up Excel as a destination.

// destination

== Add {destination} as a destination from Google Drive

. Under *Destination* on the right, select *Add destination*, and choose *Excel* from the drop-down.

. Select *Workbook* and choose the desired Workbook from the drop-down. Since {seekwell} currently only supports `.xlsx` files, this drop-down will show all `.xlsx` files in your Google Drive.

. Select *Sheet1* and enter the Sheet name you want to send data to. Please note, the entire sheet will be replaced.
+
NOTE: If you need other data points or formulas on the same Sheet, send your {seekwell} data to one sheet (e.g. "seekwell") and use a formula or pivot table to reference the data from another sheet.

. Select *A1* to enter the range using A1 notions, for example, "Sheet1!A1".

. Run your SQL. When the query is done, refresh the file in Drive to see your data.
