You can access previously deleted blocks by going to the link:https://app.seekwell.io/[{seekwell} web app,window=_blank], selecting kbd:[`command`] / kbd:[`control`] + kbd:[`k`], and searching for "trash". A menu item appears called "View Trash".

After selecting "View Trash", a list of all your previously deleted blocks appears. Select "Restore" next to whichever blocks you want to restore, and they will be available again from the link:https://app.seekwell.io/[{seekwell} web app,window=_blank].
