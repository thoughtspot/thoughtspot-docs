You can sync data from your database or warehouse to Salesforce with a simple SQL statement.

== Use the Mapping UI

. To start sending your database data to Salesforce, link:https://login.salesforce.com/services/oauth2/authorize?client_id=3MVG9LBJLApeX_PDgnQWQtipJhLKZ5zHco7lI6AVz9ZtyX5esJ_oC1b_CJMc.96ffhjXhSrT18lIXWZc5sLXT&redirect_uri=https://seekwell.io/sfdc1&response_type=code[authorize the app,window=_blank].

. Write your SQL query link:http://app.seekwell.io/[in the app,window=_blank] for the data you want to send to Salesforce, and view the results. Be sure to include the `Id` for the record in Salesforce. If you don't already have the id in your database, you can query xref:salesforce-source.adoc[Salesforce (Source)] live from {seekwell} to get another identifier that is in your database (for example, email) and join to that to get the `Id`.

. Under *Destination* on the right, select *Salesforce*. Fill the following fields:
.. Object (for example, Account)
.. Operation (for example, update)

. To the right of *Results*, select *Mapping*.

. In the Mapping UI, select columns from your query and map them to the fields in Salesforce you want to send them to.

. Once you've finished mapping all your columns to their corresponding fields in Salesforce, select *Test Sync* to ensure the sync is working. If the records have not updated, you can view your job statuses in Salesforce under menu:Setup[Bulk Data Load Jobs]. Select the *Job ID* and scroll down to view any errors. You can also view background job errors in the {seekwell} App's link:https://app.seekwell.io/feed[Feed,window=_blank].

. Add a schedule under *Repeat* so your sync runs regularly and your Salesforce data is always up-to-date.

=== Null values


Use the special value `#N/A` to "blank out" or set a field to `NULL`. For example:

[source]
----
select
u.salesforce_id as "Id",
u.email as "Email",
case when u.some_column is null then '#N/A' else u.some_column as "Custom_Data__c"
from public.users as u
----

=== Upserts

You need to specify an link:https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api_rest.meta/api_rest/dome_upsert.htm[External ID,window=_blank] (such as email) for upserts.

=== Using Parameters

You can also use Parameters to map your columns to their corresponding fields in Salesforce, as in the video below:
