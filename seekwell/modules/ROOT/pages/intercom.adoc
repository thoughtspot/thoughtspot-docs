== Getting started

With {seekwell} Intercom integration, you can easily sync data from your database to Intercom. To get started, link:https://app.intercom.io/oauth?client_id=2666fea1-41de-4aa2-a04d-e155ce8108dc&state=example[authorize your Intercom account,window=_blank] with {seekwell}.

To set up Intercom as a destination, follow these steps:

. link:https://sql.new/[Create a new SQL block,window=_blank] in {seekwell} using the plus sign in the top right of the home screen:

. Under *Destination* in the right sidebar, select *Intercom*.

. After selecting *Intercom* as the destination, select the *Mapping* option on the bottom of the page next to *Results*.
+
Here, you can choose the fields from your query to map to fields in Intercom. You can add additional columns by selecting the green *Add Column* button. Source columns must be included in the result of your SQL query.
+
Once you map the columns to their respective Intercom fields, you can test the sync by selecting the *Test Sync* button.

. Once you test the sync, you can verify the sync to Intercom was successful by selecting on the metadata above the Mapping UI to see a realtime Feed of your runs.
