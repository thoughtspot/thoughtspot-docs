== Introduction

You can use {seekwell} to send query results, either from your database or a Google Sheet, via email. The email contains an HTML preview of the results, a link back to the block, and a CSV file with the query results.

== Steps

. Within your block, select the current destination and choose *Email* from the drop-down.

. Under *Send from*, enter your email address.

. By default, {seekwell} asks you to enter the list of emails manually. To use the email list as a block, see xref:email-lists.adoc[].

. Select *Emails (comma separated list)* to enter email addresses as a comma-separated list, and select *Save*.
