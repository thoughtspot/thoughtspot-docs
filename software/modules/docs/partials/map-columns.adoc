To map the columns of the external tables to columns in ThoughtSpot's internal tables, follow these steps:

. Open the *Advanced setup* interface by clicking the toggle to open.
. Choose the *Map tables and columns* tab.
. Scroll down, to *Map the columns...* section.
. Specify the following information for columns:
 .. Select (or deselect) *columns* for syncing into ThoughtSpot.
+ By default, all columns are selected.
 .. *Search* for columns by name;
this is very useful for very wide tables.
 .. *Rename* columns in the ThoughtSpot table, for easier search.
+ To make this change, click the pencil (edit) icon next to the name of the column.
 .. *Change the data type* of the column inside the ThoughtSpot table.
+ Click the down chevron icon to open the drop-down menu, and select a new data type.
+ For example, if you know you have integer data, change the default *DOUBLE* datatype to *INT32*.
 .. Set *Primary keys* of the table by toggling the selector to the 'on' position.
+ Note that several columns may be primary keys.
 .. Set the *Sharding keys* of the table by toggling the selector to the 'on' position.
 .. Specify the *Number of shards* in the table.
. Save your work by clicking *Save*.
+ Alternatively, click *Save and sync now* to save your work and sync data at the same time.
