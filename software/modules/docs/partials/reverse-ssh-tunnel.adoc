The system asks if you have added `tunnelrelay.thoughtspot.com` to your list of allowed domains.

If you select *no*, you cannot enable or disable the reverse SSH tunnel:

If you have added `tunnelrelay.thoughtspot.com` to your list of allowed domains, by opening port `22`, the system allows you to enable or disable the reverse SSH tunnel.
