Learn the operators and functions you can use to create formulas in ThoughtSpot.

ThoughtSpot allows you to create derived columns in worksheets using formulas.
You create these columns by building formulas using the *Formula Assistant*.
An individual formula is constructed from _n_ combination of operators and functions.

This reference lists the various operators and functions you can use to create formulas.
