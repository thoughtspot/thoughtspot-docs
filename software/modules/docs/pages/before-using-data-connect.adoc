:summary: There are a few prerequisites you must complete before using ThoughtSpot Data Connect.
:toc: false

Before you can use ThoughtSpot Data Connect, you must enable the ThoughtSpot connection to Informatica, and enter the data connection credentials.

== Prerequisites

The following prerequisites and considerations apply to the data connect feature:

* Your Informatica account will be provisioned by ThoughtSpot.
* If you want to use HTTPS with your URL, you must provide a signed certificate when enabling ThoughtSpot Data Connect.
* You need outbound HTTPS (port 443 for infaagent) internet access to https://app.informaticaondemand.com/ and https://app2.informaticacloud.com/.
+
If outbound HTTPS internet access to https://app.informaticaondemand.com/ and https://app2.informaticacloud.com/ is not possible, you can instead add the Informatica Cloud IP address ranges `206.80.52.0/24`, `206.80.61.0/24`, `209.34.91.0/24`, and `209.34.80.0/24` to a list of allowed domains.

* You will also need any other internet connectivity and credentials required to access any cloud data sources you want to connect to, such as Salesforce.
No inbound access is required.
* After ThoughtSpot Data Connect is enabled, any user who belongs to a group with *Has administration privileges* or who *Can Manage Data* can use the feature.
Before enabling the feature, in sure that these privileges are configured properly.

Refer to the https://thoughtspot.egnyte.com/dl/fuxryvKclK[Informatica Cloud Security Architecture Overview] whitepaper to learn how each component and service is secured.
You can also ask ThoughtSpot Support for a copy of the document.
