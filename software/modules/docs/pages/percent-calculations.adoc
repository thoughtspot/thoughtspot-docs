== Calculate percentages

Calculating percentages is useful when you want to see, for example, the percentage of revenue that each retail department generates (gifts, bakery, canned goods, etc.).

Create a formula called `Percent Revenue` in the link:{{ site.baseurl }}/complex-search/how-to-add-formula.html[*Formula Assistant*]:

`( sum ( revenue ) / group_sum ( revenue ) ) * 100`

Replace `revenue` with your company's name for their `revenue` column, such as `revenue_dollar_amount`.

Now you can see the percentage of your total revenue that each department contributes, using the percent revenue formula that you just created.
See the example below.
