== How to specify fonts

You can set your systems default fonts by specifying either or both of the *Chart Visualization Fonts* and *Table Visualization Fonts* values.
To set this values, your font must be defined in a Web Open Font Format (`WOFF`) file.

Changes to chart and table defaults apply only to charts and features created _after_ you configure a value.
If you change table fonts, older tables retain their previous fonts.
Some settings can be overridden on a per-object level.
Users cannot configure their own defaults.

To set a new font:

== How to specify the behavior or clickable links in data

There is a system-wide setting which determines what happens when a user clicks on a link within the data.
When your data includes URLs, they display as clickable links in ThoughtSpot tables.
By default, clicking on a link opens the URL in a separate tab.
But there is a system-wide setting that can be changed to open the links within the context in which they appear.

Changing this setting opens the links:

|===
| Link type
| Opens in

| Link in search result table in ThoughtSpot
| Same browser tab as ThoughtSpot application

| Link in table embedded in an iFrame
| Same iFrame that contains the table

| Link in full ThoughtSpot application embedded in an iFrame
| Same iFrame that contains the application
