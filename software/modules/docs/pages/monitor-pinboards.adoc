== About deprecated boards

The deprecated boards (`TS status: Usage - Deprecated` and `TS StaTS: Queries -- Deprecated`) are there to support older installations.
New installations should not use or rely on deprecated boards.
Older installations that have used these boards in some way should use the new boards and remove any dependencies.
