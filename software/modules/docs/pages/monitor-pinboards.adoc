ThoughtSpot provides several pinboards that help with system monitoring.

There are several system monitoring pinboards in ThoughtSpot that provide answers for system status and resource usage questions.
The information in these pinboards are updated hourly from internal data sources that collect monitoring statistics.

Only users with administrative privilege can view the monitoring pinboards.
They are based on worksheets, which administrators can view, but not modify.

== About deprecated system pinboards

The deprecated system pinboards (`TS status: Usage - Deprecated` and `TS StaTS: Queries -- Deprecated`) are there to support older installations.

New installations should not use or rely on deprecated pinboards.

Older installations that use these pinboards should start using the new pinboards and remove any dependencies.
