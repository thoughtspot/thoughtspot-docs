= Show underlying data
:last_updated:

Viewing the underlying data of your answer gives you an un-aggregated view of the underlying data.

You can see the most granular details of a given result set, i.e.
it shows the un-aggregated view.
This feature lets you understand what an answer consists of.
For example, if you search for `customer region revenue`, the answer shows the aggregate revenue value for each customer region.
Then, you can right-click any row and then click *Show underlying data*, to see each value which constitutes `revenue` for any given region.

Only the first 1,000 rows appear when viewing the underlying data.
You can even download the results shown when you choose *Show underlying data* from a chart.
The download file limit is a million rows.

NOTE: Viewing underlying data does not work for answers that are derived from chasm trap searches.
Nor does this feature work for pivot tables.

To show underlying data:

. Right-click the visualization or table cell of interest
. Select *Show underlying data*.
