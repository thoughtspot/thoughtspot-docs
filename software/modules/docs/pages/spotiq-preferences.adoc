These parameters and threshold settings are a subset of those available on the xref:customization.adoc[SpotIQ Customize analysis] dialog.
If you set them here, the settings will persist for all your SpotIQ analyses including  when you run custom analyses, unless you explicitly reset options for a custom analysis.
