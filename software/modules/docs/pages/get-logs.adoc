= Get your configuration and logs
:last_updated: 11/18/2019

Two main troubleshooting tools are getting a log bundle and understanding your cluster configuration.

For troubleshooting on specific incidents or cluster problems, two things are important: understanding your current configuration and getting a log bundle.

== Check your configuration

. Log in to the ThoughtSpot cluster as the `admin` user.
. Use the `tscli feature` subcommand to display your current configuration.

== How to get logs

There are two ways to get logs:

* When ThoughtSpot encounters a problem, a red bar displays in the browser with an error message.
You can click *What Happened?* in the error message for more details.
To download related logs, click *Download Trace*.
Send the logs as an email attachment to the support contact that is provided.
Clicking *Report Problem* will also send the logs as an email attachment to your administrator.

* You can generate a log bundle using the `tscli` command `tscli logs collect` if you are comfortable with Linux.
The command lets you specify which logs to collect and from what time periods.
+
Usage for this command is:
+
----
  tscli logs collect
    --include <selector | glob>
    [--exclude <selector | glob>]
    [--since <hours,minutes,days>
    | --from <yyyymmdd-HH:MM>
    --to <yyyymmdd-HH:MM>]
    [--out <path>]
    [--maxsize <size_in_MB_or_GB>]
    [--sizeonly]
----
+
The full list of all selectors is:

 ** `all` collects all of the logs listed from the system and the ThoughtSpot application.
 ** `system` collects all system logs, e.g.
syslog, upstart, mail logs, etc.
 ** `ts` collects all logs from the ThoughtSpot application.
This includes falcon, sage, orion core (cluster management), etc.
 ** `orion` collects all orion logs including cluster management, hdfs, zookeeper, etc.
Detailed syntax and options are listed in the link:{{ site.baseurl }}/reference/tscli-command-ref.html#[tscli command reference].

== Examples

Here are some examples of usage for the command `tscli logs collect`:

To collect all logs from the past day to the default location (`/tmp/logs.tar.gz`):

 $ tscli logs collect --include all --since 1d

In this example, `all` is a selector for all the available logs.

In most cases, you can probably use the selector `ts` to only capture logs for the ThoughtSpot application:

 $ tscli logs collect --include ts --since 2d

For debugging cluster management issues, use a command like this one, which collects logs for system and orion from the past 2 hours.
The output is written to /tmp/debug.tar.gz as specified using `--out`:

 $ tscli logs collect --include system,orion --since 2h --out /tmp/debug.tar.gz

This command collects logs from a specific time window:

 $ tscli logs collect --include system,orion --from 20150520-12:00 --to 20150522-12:30

Advanced usage alert!
You can also use `--include` and `--exclude` to specify filesystem paths as a glob pattern.
This works like the Linux find(1) command.
Pass all the entries in `--include` starting with `/` to find(1), and all entries in `--exclude` which are not selectors to find(1) using the `-not -path` flag.

 $ tscli logs collect --include system,orion --exclude *hadoop*,*zookeeper* --since 2h

The above command collects all system and all orion logs, but excludes hadoop (hdfs) and zookeeper logs.
See xref:upload-logs-egnyte.adoc[Upload logs to ThoughtSpot Support] about using a secure file sever to collect log files or other files needed for troubleshooting.
You can easily send log files to this file serve directly from the ThoughtSpot instance.
