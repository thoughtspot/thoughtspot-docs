== Where can I find the version of ThoughtSpot I am using?

Users with administrative privileges can see this displayed on the menu:Admin[System Health > Overview] page.

== I'm not seeing certain columns/values in the drop-down, why?

It could be the index has not built with the latest data or something is causing the column to be dropped.

* Verify the the column is available using the *Data* page.
* View the table columns and check the *INDEX TYPE* value.
If it is set to `DONT_INDEX`, change it.
* Check the column's  *INDEX PRIORITY*.
Make sure it is `1`.
