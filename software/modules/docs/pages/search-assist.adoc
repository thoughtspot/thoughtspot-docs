== Search Assist

ThoughtSpot uses a simple search approach to generate tables and visualizations. Use Search Assist to learn how to get original Answers to all your business questions.

Search Assist walks you through simple search scenarios.
It demonstrates how anyone can get answers to their data questions by typing in the Search bar.

The initial example asks, *_What were sales for all products in 2019?_*

Search Assist guides you to phrase this search as *_sales product 2019_*.

The search then returns the Answer as a table.

The additional searches also return Answers, either in table form or as chart, to these questions:

* *_What were sales for shirts in 2019, per quarter?_*
+
The correct search here is, *_sales shirts 2019 quarterly_*.
* *_What were the top-selling products during the last quarter?_*
+
The search here is, *_sales product last quarter top_*.
* *_How many bags were sold per city over the last 12 months?_*
+
The search is, *_quantity purchased bags last 12 months city_*.

The default Search Assist experience uses sample retail data. You can also use your own data to create your own Search Assist example queries, so your users can learn how to use ThoughtSpot's relational search on data that is relevant to them.
