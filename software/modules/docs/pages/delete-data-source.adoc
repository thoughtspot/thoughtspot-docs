Learn how to delete a data source without inadvertently deleting data in ThoughtSpot.

This is useful when you make changes to a table and create a new data source that loads into the table.
So, you can safely delete any data source that references a target table that you don't want to lose.

Before you begin, if there are any recurring data load jobs for the data source you are deleting, follow the steps in xref:stop-scheduled-job.adoc[Stop a scheduled job from running].
Then, do the following to delete a data source:

. Log in to ThoughtSpot from a browser.
. Click *Data*, on the top navigation bar.
. Click the *Data Sources* tab at the top of the screen.
