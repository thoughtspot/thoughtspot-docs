= Change the footer text
:last_updated: 2/24/2020


You can customize ThoughtSpot's footer test to add a company-specific message.

The ThoughtSpot footer appears by default in the ThoughtSpot application.
It also appears with an embed application that encompasses an individual pinboard or a full application.
In embed applications that have a single visualization, you can ask your ThoughtSpot support engineer to disable the footer.

While you cannot remove the footer, you can customize it by adding a company-specific message.
