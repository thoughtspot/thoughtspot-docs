Learn how to rate a SpotIQ insight.

With SpotIQ analysis and insight feedback, you can rate an insight by clicking the like image:thumb_up.png[more options menu icon] or dislike image:thumb_down.png[more options menu icon] icon of the insight.

NOTE: Insights are turned off by default.
They do not appear on the Home page, or on Pinboards, unless your administrator turns on the feature.

When you click dislike, you can provide more details on why you disliked the insight by answering the questions based on the type of insight, decisions made by SpotIQ during analysis, aggregation, and so on.
These questions help determine if the features of an insight are relevant, or too obvious.

////
The following are examples of questions based on different types of insights.

*Anomaly insight:* <br>
