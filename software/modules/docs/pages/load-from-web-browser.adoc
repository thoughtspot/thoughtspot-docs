== Formatting the CSV

Your ETL (extract, transform, load) process will typically generate CSV files.
You can also create a CSV file from a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet by opening the spreadsheet in Excel, choosing *Save As* and selecting CSV.

If you are loading a fact table that joins to dimension tables, you must load the fact table first, and then the dimension tables.
The joining key must be a single column of unique values in the dimension table.
`NULL` values in the fact table cannot be joined.
