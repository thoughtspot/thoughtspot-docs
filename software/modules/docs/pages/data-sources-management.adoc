= Data sources management


After you have successfully loaded your tables, you can check on the status of the load, make edits, and more.

You can manage your new data sources by clicking on the name of your source on the *Data Sources* page.
You can have up to 50 scheduled jobs on your cluster at time.
Contact ThoughtSpot Support if you'd like to increase this limit.

After selecting a data source, you have the option to perform a number of editing and maintenance tasks.

== Schedule, edit, and refresh

You can select a table row and click one of the following three buttons to make changes:

* *Schedule*: Opens a Scheduler menu where you can make changes to the loading schedule.
* *Edit*: Takes you back to edit the data source details, such as loading another table or truncating an existing one.
* *Refresh*: Refreshes the data load status.
