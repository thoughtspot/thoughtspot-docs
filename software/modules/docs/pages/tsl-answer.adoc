Scriptability for Answers and Pinboards is in [.label.label-beta]#Beta#.
To enable Scriptable Answers and Pinboards, contact ThoughtSpot Support.

To work with Scriptable Answers in ThoughtSpot, you can download Answers to a flat file in `TSL`, ThoughtSpot's Scripting Language, modify it, and subsequently upload this file either to the same cluster, or to a different cluster.

== Syntax of the Answer TSL file

The `TSL` file for Scriptable Answers has a specific syntax.

See the <<parameters,Parameters>> section for details about the keywords used in this example.

You may not see each of these parameters in your own TSL files, depending on whether each variable is explicitly defined.
For example, if you did not define any conditional formatting, the `conditional_formatting` variable does not appear.
You can add that variable in the TSL file to specify conditional formatting.

[#parameters]
== Parameters of the Answer TSL file
aggregation:: The aggregation of the output for a formula within an Answer.
+
Aggregation options depend on the data type.
+
Possible values: `SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVERAGE`, `MAX`, `MIN`, `COUNT_DISTINCT`, `NONE`, `STD_DEVIATION`, and `VARIANCE` + Default: `SUM`

alias:: An alternate name for the table.

answer:: Top-level container for all object definitions within an Answer.

answer_columns:: A list of columns generated by the search query.

axis_configs:: Specifies the columns for each axis on a chart. If you are displaying a column chart with a line chart overlaying it, for example, you would need to specify more than one `axis_config`.

chart:: Contains configuration for the Answer, if it displays in chart format.

chart_columns::  A list of columns in the chart.

client_state::  A JSON string with more advanced chart and table configuration.

color::  Color to use for conditional formatting or for the columns of an Answer in chart form, in the form of a HEX value.

column_id:: Specifies the way the column appears in the query.
For example, if you sorted by `Quarter` in your search, from the `Commit Date` column, the `column_id` of the column is `Quarter(Commit Date)`.
Refer to xref:search-data-api.adoc#components[Components of a Search Query] to understand syntax.

column_type:: The type of data the column represents. For a formula in an Answer, the `column_type` refers to the output of the formula.
+
Possible values: `MEASURE` or `ATTRIBUTE`
+
The default depends on the <<data_type,data_type>>. If the data type is `Numeric` or `Decimal`, the formula output's `column_type` defaults to `Measure`. If the data type is `Boolean`, `Text`, `Date`, `Datetime`, or `Time`, the formula output's `column_type` defaults to `Attribute`.
+
conditional_formatting:: Conditional formatting for the chart or table of an Answer.

custom_name::  Optional display name for a column.

data_type:: The data type of the formula output. If the data type is `Numeric` or `Decimal`, the formula output's `column_type` defaults to `Measure`. If the data type is `Boolean`, `Text`, `Date`, `Datetime`, or `Time`, the formula output's `column_type` defaults to `Attribute`. The possible data types are `Boolean`, `Text`, `Date`, `Datetime`, `Time`, `Numeric`, and `Decimal`.+++</dlentry>++++++<dlentry id="description">+++description::::  The text that describes an object: a `worksheet`, a `worksheet_column`, `answer`, `pinboard`, and so on.

destination::  Name of destination table or view of the join

display_mode:: Determines whether the Answer displays as a chart or a table. Specify either `CHART_MODE` or `TABLE_MODE`.

expr::  The definition of the formula

formulas:: The list of formulas in the Answer.
+
Each formula is identified by `name`, the `expr` (expression), and an optional `id` attribute.

fqn::  A GUID for the table name

headline_aggregation:::: Specifies the type of headline aggregation. Can be `COUNT`, `COUNT_DISTINCT`, `SUM`, `MIN`, `MAX`, `AVERAGE`, or `TABLE_AGGR`.

id:: Specifies the way the column appears in the query. For example, if you sorted by `Quarter` in your search, from the `Commit Date` column, the `id` of the column is `Quarter(Commit Date)`.
Refer to xref:search-data-api.adoc#components[Components of a Search Query] to understand syntax.
+
For formulas within Answers, `id` refers to the display name of the formula. If you do not give your formula a name, it appears as 'Untitled Formula'.

is_one_to_one::  Specifies the cardinality of the join
+
Possible values: `true`, `false` + Default: `false`

join_path:: Specification of a composite join as a list of distinct `join` attributes + These `join` attributes list relevant joins, previously defined in the `joins`, by name.
+
Default: `{}`

join_progressive:: Specifies when to apply joins on a worksheet
+
Possible values: `true` when joins are applied only for tables whose columns are included in the search, and `false` for all possible joins + Default: `true`
+
See xref:progressive-joins.adoc[How the worksheet join rule works]

joins:: List of joins between tables and views, used by the data source, if it is a Worksheet.
+
Each join is identified by `name`, and the additional attributes of `source`, `destination`, `type`, and `is_one_to_one.`

layout:: Specifies the Pinboard layout, in the order that a `visualization_id` is listed.

locked:: The 'automatically select my chart' option in the UI. If set to `true`, the chart type does not change, even when you add items to the query.

max:: Maximum value for conditional formatting.

min::  Minimum value for conditional formatting.

name:: The name of an object. Applies to `worksheet`, `table`,`join`, `formula`, `answer`, `pinboard` and so on.
+
For Answers, `name` refers to how the column appears in the query. For example, if you sorted by `Quarter` in your search, from the `Commit Date` column, the `name` of the column is `Quarter(Commit Date)`. Refer to xref:search-data-api.adoc#components[Components of a Search Query] to understand syntax.

on:: The keys that your tables are joined on.

ordered_column_ids::  A list of columns, in the order they appear in the table.

properties:: The properties of the output for a formula within an Answer.
+
For Answers, each formula's output can have the following properties, depending on its definition: `column_type` and `aggregation`.

plotAsBand:: Specifies whether to plot the chart conditional formatting like a band on the Visualization. This is the 'fill chart' option in the UI.

range:: Range for the conditional formatting to apply to, with a specified `min` and `max`.

rule::  A conditional formatting rule.

search_query:: A string that represents the fully disambiguated search query. Refer to xref:search-data-api.adoc#components[Components of a Search Query] to understand syntax.

tables:: List of tables used by the Answer.
+
Each table is identified by `name`.

type:: This refers to both the join type and the chart type.
+
Possible values for the join type: `LEFT_OUTER` for left outer join, `RIGHT_OUTER` for right outer join, `INNER` for inner join, `OUTER` for full outer join + Default: `INNER` + Possible values for the chart type: `COLUMN`, `BAR`, `LINE`, `PIE`, `SCATTER`, `BUBBLE`, `STACKED_COLUMN`, `AREA`, `PARETO`, `COLUMN`, `GEO_AREA`, `GEO_BUBBLE`, `GEO_HEATMAP`, `GEO_EARTH_BAR`, `GEO_EARTH_AREA`, `GEO_EARTH_GRAPH`, `GEO_EARTH_BUBBLE`, `GEO_EARTH_HEATMAP`, `WATERFALL`, `TREEMAP`, `HEATMAP`, `STACKED_AREA`, `LINE_COLUMN`, `FUNNEL`, `LINE_STACKED_COLUMN`, `PIVOT_TABLE`, `SANKEY`, `GRID_TABLE`, `SPIDER_WEB`, `WHISKER_SCATTER`, `STACKED_BAR`, or `CANDLESTICK`.+++</dlentry>+++

[#limitations]
== Limitations of working with TSL files

There are certain limitations to the changes you can apply by editing an Answer through TSL.

* Formulas and columns can either have a new name, or a new expression.
You cannot change both, unless migrating or updating the Answer two times.
* It is not possible to reverse the join direction in the TSL script.
* You cannot create Scriptable representations of R- or Python-powered visualizations.
