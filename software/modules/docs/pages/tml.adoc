Use ThoughtSpot Modeling Language to modify a Worksheet, View, table, Pinboard, SpotIQ result, or Answer in a flat-file format. Then you can migrate the object to a different cluster, or restore it to the same cluster.

To work with Scriptable <<syntax-worksheets,Worksheets>>, <<syntax-views,Views>>, <<syntax-tables,tables>>, <<syntax-answers,Answers>>, <<syntax-pinboards,SpotIQ results>>, and <<syntax-pinboards,Pinboards>> in ThoughtSpot, you can download these objects to a flat file in `TML` format, modify it, and subsequently upload this file either to the same cluster, or to a different cluster.
To learn how to export, change, and update Worksheets, Views, Tables, Answers, SpotIQ results, and Pinboards, see xref:scriptability.adoc[Scriptability].
