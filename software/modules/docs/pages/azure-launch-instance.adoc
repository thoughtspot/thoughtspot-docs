:experimental:

After you determine your configuration options, you must set up your virtual machines using a ThoughtSpot image for Azure.

== About the ThoughtSpot image

To provision ThoughtSpot in the Azure portal, access the ThoughtSpot Virtual Machine in the Azure Marketplace.

The ThoughtSpot Virtual Machine comes provisioned with the custom ThoughtSpot image to make hosting simple.
A virtual machine is a preconfigured template that provides the information required to launch an instance of ThoughtSpot.
It includes a root disk for the instance, which contains an operating system, application server, and other necessary software.

The ThoughtSpot Virtual Machine has the ThoughtSpot software installed and configured, on a CentOS-based image.
Check with your ThoughtSpot contact to learn about the latest version of the ThoughtSpot Virtual Machine.

Due to security restrictions, the ThoughtSpot Virtual Machine does not have default passwords for the administrator users.
When you are ready to obtain the password, contact https://community.thoughtspot.com/customers/s/contactsupport[ThoughtSpot Support,window="_blank"].

This guide explains how to deploy ThoughtSpot on Azure, using ThoughtSpot's CentOS-based image.
You can also deploy ThoughtSpot on Azure using Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) or Oracle Enterprise Linux (OEL), allowing you to run ThoughtSpot on an RHEL 7.8 or 7.9 or OEL 7.9 image that your organization manages internally.
To install ThoughtSpot using RHEL or OEL, refer to the xref:rhel.adoc[RHEL and OEL deployment guide] after you launch your virtual machines.

[#port-requirements]
=== Minimum required ports

Open the following ports between the User/ETL server and ThoughtSpot nodes. This ensures that the ThoughtSpot processes do not get blocked.

The minimum ports requirements are:

Port 22::
  Protocol: SSH
  Service: Secure Shell access

Port 443::
  Protocol: HTTPS
  Service: Secure Web access

Port 12345::
  Protocol: TCP
  Service: ODBC and JDBC drivers access

NOTE: Nodes purchased from Azure must be reachable to each other so that they can communicate and form a distributed environment.
ThoughtSpot requires that these ports be accessible between nodes within a cluster.
Use your discretion about whether to restrict public access or not for all nodes and all ports.

Refer to xref:ports.adoc[Network ports] for more information.

[#prepare-for-startup]
=== Prepare for starting up ThoughtSpot

_Prerequisite_: To log into the VM, you need the private key that is available in the image.
You can obtain this from your ThoughtSpot contact.

. Obtain the VM's public and private IP addresses.
 ** To see the public IP, click the VM name link.
This will show the public IP of the VM.
 ** To see the private IP, select *more services* from the Microsoft Azure homepage.
Select *Networking* from the list on the left side of the screen.
. In a terminal application, connect to the VM through SSH.
+
Log in as the admin user, using the private key that your ThoughtSpot contact sent you.

 $ ssh -i <path_to_private_key> admin@<public_VM_IP>
+

. Update the password for both the `admin` and the `thoughtspot` users.
+   The command prompts you to type in a new password, and then to confirm the password.

 $ sudo passwd admin
 Changing password for user admin
 $ sudo passwd thoughtspot
 Changing password for user thoughtspot
+
WARNING: If you do not change the password, you cannot log back into your Azure VMs.
Your private key does not work after initial installation.

. Update the file `/etc/hosts` with all the node IP addresses for the other VMs that will be part of the ThoughtSpot cluster.

=== Verify storage disks

Verify the existence of your data disks, created in Step 4 of <<create-instance,create an instance>>, by issuing `lsblk` in your terminal application:

----
   $ lsblk
----

Your result may look something like the following:

----
   NAME    MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
   fd0       2:0    1    4K  0 disk
   sda       8:0    0  200G  0 disk
   ├─sda1    8:1    0    1G  0 part /mntboot
   ├─sda2    8:2    0   20G  0 part /
   ├─sda3    8:3    0   20G  0 part /update
   └─sda4    8:4    0  159G  0 part /export
   sdb       8:16   0    1T  0 disk
   └─sb1     8:17   0    1T  0 part /mnt/resource
   sdc       8:32   0    1T  0 disk
   sdd       8:48   0    1T  0 disk
   sr0      11:0    1  628K  0 rom
----

. Unmount the temporary disk by issuing the following command:

 $ sudo umount /mnt/resource
+
WARNING: The `/mnt/resource` disk, which is mounted on the `/dev/sdb` disk, is temporary.
Any data on it will be wiped if the VM is shut down.
You must unmount the `/mnt/resource` disk.

. Prepare the disks /dev/sdc and /dev/sdd for ThoughtSpot by issuing the following command:
+
WARNING: Do not use the disk `/dev/sdb`.
Any data on it will be wiped if the VM is shut down.
+
----
 $ sudo /usr/local/scaligent/bin/prepare_disks.sh /dev/sdc /dev/sdd
----

. Check the disks' status by issuing the following command:

 $ df -h

. Repeat the steps in this section for each node in your cluster.
