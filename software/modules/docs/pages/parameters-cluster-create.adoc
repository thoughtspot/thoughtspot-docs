== Using the tscli cluster create command

To install your appliance, you must install the cluster.

. *Copy the release tarball* In your Terminal (Apple) or using https://winscp.net/eng/index.php[Winscp,window=_blank] (Windows application), copy the downloaded release tarball to /home/admin/ and run the cluster installer as shown below.
+
Run the secure copy command: `scp <release-number> admin@<hostname>:/home/admin/<file-name>`.
Note the following parameters:
+
** `release-number` is the version of ThoughtSpot you have on your cluster, such as `6.0` or `5.3`.
`release-number` is of the form `0.0.tar.gz`.
** `hostname` is your network hostname.
Ask your network administrator if you do not know your hostname.
** `file-name` is the name of the tarball file on your local machine.
For example:
+
[source]
----
scp 6.0.tar.gz admin@ThoughtSpot:/home/admin/TS-tarball.
----
+
ThoughtSpot recommends that you start the session using https://linux.die.net/man/1/screen[screen,window=_blank], so you do not lose your progress if you lose your connection at any point.
+
[source]
----
scp <release-number> admin@<hostname>:/home/admin/<file-name>
----
. *Run the `cluster create` command* Run `tscli cluster create <release-number>` in your terminal.
+
If you are using an s3 or GCS bucket for object storage, include the flag `--enable_cloud_storage=s3` or `--enable_cloud_storage=gcs`.
GCS is GCP's object storage, and s3 is AWS's object storage.
+
[source,tscli]
----
tscli cluster create 6.0.tar.gz --enable_cloud_storage=s3
----
+
[source,tscli]
----
tscli cluster create 6.0.tar.gz --enable_cloud_storage=gcs
----
