:summary: Editing the layout of a pinboard lets you snap visualizations into place, choose between set visualization sizes, and reset your layout.

Visualizations within a pinboard are easy to move around and snap into place on a relative flow layout.

Charts and graphs can be toggled between a small, medium, and full width size, while headlines can be only one size (small).
One row of the pinboard can hold a predetermined number of visualizations of each size.
