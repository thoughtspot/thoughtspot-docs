= Add a geographical data setting
:last_updated: 3/26/2020


Learn how to model your geographical data.

Certain attribute columns that contain location data can be used to create GeoMaps.
ThoughtSpot supports Latitude, Longitude, Zip Code, US States, US Counties, Countries, and select international sub-nation regions.

You can designate a column as `Geo` by editing the *GEO CONFIG* column in the table *Columns* page.
You cannot edit the geo configuration column information in the `model.xls` file.

== Guidelines for geographic columns

Columns that can be designated as `Geo` columns need to contain text (`VARCHAR`) data unless they contain latitude/longitude data.
Latitude and longitude columns can contain numeric data (`DOUBLE`) or text.

If you import `geo` columns as numeric values, the data type defaults to `BIGINT`.
ThoughtSpot recommends that you import `geo` columns, such as zipcodes as text values.
The `column type` defaults to  `measure` when you import numeric values.
In ThoughtSpot, a `measure` is a numeric value that you can you use in mathematical formulas.
For geo data, you *_must_* change the `column type` to `attribute` and specify `additive` as `no`.

If you are using a column with the data type `DOUBLE` for latitude and longitude, change the following settings for those columns:

* set *Column Type* to `ATTRIBUTE`
* set *Additive* to `NO`
* set *Aggregation Type* to `NONE`

For information on these settings, see link:change-aggreg-additive.html[Set ADDITIVE or AGGREGATION].

As a best practice, you should make the following changes to your geographical data *_before_* importing it to ThoughtSpot:

. Specify `geo` columns as text values, and not numeric.
. Make sure your data is specific, and does not contain duplicates.

| For example, you may be collecting data for locations in Washington County, Alabama, and also for locations in Washington County, Wisconsin.
+  + According to the 2010 Census, there are 31 distinct Washington Counties in the United States.
+  + To account for multiple different geographical entities with the same name, you must be specific within your data.
+  + A value of _Washington County_ without a state attached to it may result in incorrect or incomplete geo maps.

== How to edit geographic columns

. Find the *GEO CONFIG* for the column that contains the geographical data.
. Select the column to display the *Specify Geographic Configuration* dialog.

. Change the value to the appropriate *GEO CONFIG*, depending on the kind of geo data the column contains.
+
If your data includes latitude and/or longitude columns that are stored as a  numeric data type (`DOUBLE`), make these changes for those columns:

 .. Change the *Type* to `ATTRIBUTE`.
 .. Change *ADDITIVE* to `NO`/`FALSE`.

. Save your changes.
