The line stacked column chart combines stacked column and line charts.

The line column chart combines the column and line charts.
Your search needs at least one attribute and two measures to be represented as a line column chart.

== Understand line column charts

Line column charts display one measure as a column chart and the other as a line chart.
Each of these measures has its own y-axis.
