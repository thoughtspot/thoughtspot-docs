= Comparative Analysis
:last_updated: 11/25/2020


With SpotIQ competitive analysis, you can compare two data points for complex measures.


SpotIQ competitive analysis compares data points of simple or complex measures using these aggregates:

* _Sum_
* _Count_
* _Sum over sum_, which generate a Pinboard that has 'what-if' percentage insights
* _Average_, which generate a Pinboard that has 'what-if' percentage insights
* Other functions which use a 'versus' analysis to show the absolute change grouped by different drill attributes

NOTE: Insights are turned off by default.
They do not appear on the Home page, or on Pinboards, unless your administrator turns on the feature.
