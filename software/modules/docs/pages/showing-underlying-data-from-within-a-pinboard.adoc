:last_updated: 11/24/2020


Learn about searching within a pinboard.

You can perform many of the same search actions on individual visualizations within a pinboard as you can within a search.
You can interact directly with a visualization of a pinboard to perform ad hoc searches or edit it.
These search actions include the following:

* Editing a search - You can edit the original search and reconfigure the answer.
Click the *More* menu icon image:icon-ellipses.png[more options menu icon] to the upper-right of your visualization and select *Edit*.
