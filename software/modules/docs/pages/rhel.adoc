Run ThoughtSpot on your own internally managed RedHat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7.8 or 7.9 image, or on an Oracle Enterprise Linux (OEL) 7.9 image.

You have the flexibility to run ThoughtSpot on an RHEL 7.8 or 7.9 image or an OEL 7.9 image that your organization manages internally.

ThoughtSpot certifies RHEL 7.8 and 7.9 and OEL 7.9 on the following platforms:

* [*_RHEL only_*] Bare metal deployments on the two ThoughtSpot-certified hardware appliances: xref:installing-dell.adoc[DELL] and xref:installing-smc.adoc[SMC]
* Cloud deployments: xref:aws-configuration-options.adoc[Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2], xref:azure-configuration-options.adoc[Microsoft Azure] (RHEL only), and xref:gcp-configuration-options.adoc[Google Cloud Platform (GCP)]
* xref:vmware-intro.adoc[VMware]

NOTE: ThoughtSpot does *_not_* certify OEL on Microsoft Azure, SMC, or Dell.
