To successfully deploy ThoughtSpot in your organization, you must have the following packages on each node of your ThoughtSpot cluster: <<yum,yum>>, <<pip,python 3>>, and <<r,R>>.
When the Ansible playbook runs, it automatically installs them.

ThoughtSpot works with the latest version of each package;
