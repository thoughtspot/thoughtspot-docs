| Data center with proper environment controls, such as cooling.

| &#10063;
| AC power

| &#10063;
| 10G connection: You need one SFP+ for each node for the switch side.
Dell supplies SFP+'s for the appliance side.

| &#10063;
| 10GbE network cables, either direct attach copper (DAC) or fiber.
See the xref:cable-networking.adoc[cable reference] for more information to decide between the two types.

You also need to know the timezone for your cluster.
Typically, your timezone is where most of the people who will use the product are.
