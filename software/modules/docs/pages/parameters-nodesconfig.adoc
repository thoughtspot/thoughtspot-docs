Learn the parameters of the nodes.config file to install  your cloud or hardware appliance.

[#using-nodes.config]
== Using the nodes.config file

As you install your appliance, you must configure the nodes.

. Run the configuration command in your terminal.
+
----
 $ tscli cluster get-config |& tee nodes.config
----

. Add network information for your nodes in the `nodes.config` file output, as demonstrated in xref:nodesconfig-example.adoc[the nodes.config file] example.
+ Run `vim nodes.config` to edit the file.
+
----
 $ vim nodes.config
----
+
Fill in the areas specified in xref:parameters-nodesconfig.adoc#parameters-nodes.config[Parameters of `nodes.config`] with your specific network information.
NOTE: Some of the information in the `nodes.config` file may be pre-populated from earlier steps.
For example, if you specified an IP address while creating VMs, that IP address might already be present in your `nodes.config` file.

. If you have  additional nodes, complete this process for each node.

Do not edit any part of the nodes.config file except the sections explained in xref:parameters-nodesconfig.adoc#parameters-nodes.config[Parameters of `nodes.config`].
If you delete quotation marks, commas, or other parts of the code, setup may fail.

See xref:parameters-nodesconfig.adoc#parameters-nodes.config[Parameters of `nodes.config`] to understand the parameters in the file.
Different hardware and cloud installations have different parameters.
Your installation may not require all the listed parameters.

[#parameters-nodes.config]
=== Parameters of the nodes.config file

*ClusterId* and *Cluster Name*: Leave these two parameters blank.
You fill them out later, when running `tscli cluster create`.

*DataNetmask*	The IP of the data netmask, in the form 000.000.000.000.
For example, 255.255.252.0.

*DataGateway*	The IP of the data gateway, in the form 000.000.000.000.
For example, 192.168.4.1.

*IPMINetmask*	The IP of the Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI) netmask, in the form 000.000.000.000.
For example, 255.255.252.0.

*IPMIGateway*	The IP of the Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI) gateway, in the form 000.000.000.000.
For example, 192.168.4.1.

*Timezone*	The timezone the majority of your ThoughtSpot users are in, in the form Country/City.
For example, America/Los_Angeles.
To find your timezone and a city you can use to identify it, use https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones[this timezone list].

*NTPServers*	The address of your company's Network Time Protocol (NTP) server.
If your company does not have an NTP server, you can use one of ThoughtSpot's, as listed in xref:nodesconfig-example.adoc#autodiscovery-of-one-node-example[the nodes.config] example under NTPServers.
For example, 0.centos.pool.ntp.org.

*DNS*	The address of your company's Domain Name Server (DNS).
For example, 192.168.2.200,8.8.8.8.

WARNING: Configure only two DNS servers.
ThoughtSpot does not support configuration of three DNS servers.

NOTE: You can only edit DNS settings with this command if you are deploying ThoughtSpot on hardware.
ThoughtSpot does not support using `set-config` to edit your DNS settings for cloud deployment.

*SearchDomains*	The domain of your company or organization, in the form example.company.com.

*Hostname*	The name of the host server.
For example, Thoughtspot-server1.

*IPv4*	The main IP address, associated with DataNetmask and DataGateway, in the form 000.000.000.000.
For example, 192.168.7.70.

*IPMI IPv4*	A secondary IP address, associated with the IPMINetmask and IPMIGateway, in the form 000.000.000.000.
For example, 192.168.5.70.
