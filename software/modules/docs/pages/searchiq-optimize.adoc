= Optimize SearchIQ
:last_updated: 09/23/2019

For SearchIQ to work well, you must enable, optimize, and enable it on the data source.

SearchIQ is in [.label.label-beta]#Beta#.

NOTE: SearchIQ is turned off by default, you can have ThoughtSpot Support enable it for you.
SearchIQ is only available in English.

SearchIQ is a search experience that understands a more natural, speech-like search language.
Contrast it with the xref:about-starting-a-new-search.adoc[original ThoughtSpot search].
For example, you can search for _`What was my top selling product last month?`_, instead of typing _`top 1 product by sales last month`_.
You can also speak your search using the voice-to-text capability of your operating system.

Data source owners must enable SearchIQ for their data sources, and then optimize the data source so users get better results.
These are the primary steps for enabling and optimizing SearchIQ:

== Add Experts

== How does SearchIQ work for end Users

After you finish training SearchIQ on the Dataset, we recommend that you share with the users a list of the questions you used for training SearchIQ, the names of columns and their descriptions, common synonyms, and some guidance on how to ask a question.

Remember that users who experience SearchIQ see only the columns that SearchIQ knows.
