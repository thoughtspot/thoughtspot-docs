= Data types

ThoughtSpot supports the common data types.

Before you import data, compare the data types you want to load with these supported data types.
Then, convert your data before loading it.
Typically, you would export the data, transform it to meet these type rules, and then load the data.
This is known as an extract-transform-load process.

== Supported data types

The tables you create to receive the data must have the same number of columns and data types as the data you will be loading.
Choose a data type for each column from the list of supported data types:

[width="100%",options="header",cols="20%,20%,60%"]
|====================
|Data|Supported data types|Details
|Character|VARCHAR(*n*)|Specify the maximum number of characters, as in VARCHAR(255). The size limit is 64MB for VARCHAR values.
|Floating point|DOUBLE or FLOAT|DOUBLE is recommended. DOUBLE has a range of 1.7E +/- 308 (15 digits).
|Boolean|BOOL|Can be true or false.
|Integer|INT or BIGINT|INT holds 32 bits. BIGINT holds 64 bits. INT has a range of –2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647. BIGINT has a range of –9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807.
|Date or time|DATE,  DATETIME, TIMESTAMP, TIME|DATETIME, TIMESTAMP, and TIME are stored at the granularity of seconds. TIMESTAMP is identical to DATETIME, but is included for syntax compatibility.
|====================

WARNING: There is a 64MB limitation on the number of characters for `VARCHAR`.
If you have any `VARCHAR` data that exceeds this limit, the entire load will fail.

== Geographical data types

ThoughtSpot supports geographical data.

=== How to import geographical data

Import your geographical data as *text* values.
This ensures that the data defaults to the correct configuration, where the data type is `VARCHAR`.
You can use `DOUBLE` or `VARCHAR` for latitude and longitude data.
See the following example:

image::geoconfig-zipcodes.png[Geo data example]
In the above example, the zipcodes were imported as text values.
By default, the `data type` is `VARCHAR`, the `column type` is `attribute`, and `additive` is `no`.
You must specify the `geo config` for your data yourself.
ThoughtSpot does not specify geo config automatically.

If you import zipcodes as numeric values, the `column type` defaults to  `measure`.
In ThoughtSpot, a `measure` is a numeric value that you can you use in mathematical formulas.
If you import your geographical data as numeric values, you *_must_* change the `column type` to `attribute` and specify `additive` as `no`.

=== Latitude and longitude

For latitude and longitude, you can use either `VARCHAR` or `DOUBLE`.
Note that your latitude and longitude data must be in the form of positive and negative numbers, and not in the form of degrees.
North of the Equator, latitude values are *positive*, and south of the Equator, latitude values are *negative*.
East of the Prime Meridian, longitude values are *positive*, and West of the Prime Meridian, longitude values are *negative*.

=== Designate your geographical data in ThoughtSpot

After loading the data, designate it as a geographical data type when you link:{{ site.baseurl }}/admin/data-modeling/edit-model-file.html#[Edit the system-wide data model].
Wherever abbreviations or codes are used, they are the same as what the USPS (United States Postal Service) recognizes.

These data types can be designated as geographical data, which enables them to be visualized using the Geo chart types:

* Countries, for example:
 ** United States
  *** `long name`: United States
  *** `name_sort`: United States of America
  *** `abbreviation`: U.S.A.
  *** `adm0_a3`: USA
  *** `adm0_a3_is`: USA
  *** `adm0_a3_us`: USA
  *** `admin`: United States of America
  *** `brk_a3`: USA
  *** `brk_name`: United States
  *** `formal_en`: United States of America
  *** `iso_a2`: US
  *** `iso_a3`: USA
  *** `iso_n3`: 840
* `COUNTY` for counties in the United States, for example:
 ** santa clara county
 ** pike county, ohio
 ** pike county, OH
* `STATE_PROVINCE` for states in the United States, for example:
 ** `name`: California
 ** `US Postal Service abbreviation`: CA
* `LATITUDE`, which must be used with `LONGITUDE`, for example:
 ** 37.421023
 ** -1.282911
* `LONGITUDE`, which must be used with `LATITUDE`, for example:
 ** 122.142103
 ** -103.848865
* `ZIP_CODE` for zip codes in the United States, for example:
 ** `po_name`: MT MEADOWS AREA
 ** `ZIP`: "00012"
 ** `zip2`: 12
* Other Sub-nation Regions, which are administrative regions found in countries other than the United States, for example:
 ** bremen
 ** normandy
 ** west midlands

IMPORTANT: You cannot upload your own custom boundaries.
