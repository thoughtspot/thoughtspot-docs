Refer to your welcome letter from ThoughtSpot to find the link to download the release bundle.
If you do not have a link, open a support ticket with xref:contact.adoc[ThoughtSpot Support] to request access to the release bundle.

[#cluster-step-1]
=== Step 1: Run the installer

. Copy the downloaded release bundle to `/export/sdb1/TS_TASKS/install` using the following command:
+
----
 $ scp <release-number>.tar.gz admin@<hostname>:/export/sdb1/TS_TASKS/install/<file-name>
----
+
Note the following parameters:

 ** `release-number` is the release number of your ThoughtSpot instance, such as 5.3, 6.0, and so on.
 ** `hostname` is your specific hostname.
 ** `file-name` is the name of the tarball file on your local computer.

+
NOTE: You can use another secure copy method, if you prefer a method other than the `scp` command.

. Alternatively, use `tscli fileserver download-release` to download the release bundle.
+ You must xref:tscli-command-ref.adoc#tscli-fileserver[configure the fileserver] by running `tscli fileserver configure` before you can download the release.
+
+
----
 $ tscli fileserver download-release <release-number> --user <username> --out <release-location>
----
+
Note the following parameters:

 ** `release-number` is the release number of your ThoughtSpot instance, such as 5.3, 5.3.1, 6.0, and so on.
 ** `username` is the username for the fileserver that you set up earlier, when configuring the fileserver.
 ** `release-location` is the location path of the release bundle on your local machine.
For example, `/export/sdb1/TS_TASKS/install/6.0.tar.gz`.

. Verify the checksum to ensure you have the correct release.
+ Run `md5sum -c <release-number>.tar.gz.MD5checksum`.
+
----
 $ md5sum -c <release-number>.tar.gz.MD5checksum
----
+
Your output says `ok` if you have the correct release.

. Launch a https://linux.die.net/man/1/screen[screen,window=_blank] session.
Use screen to ensure that your installation does not stop if you lose network connectivity.
+
----
 $ screen -S DEPLOYMENT
----

. Create the cluster.
+ Run `tscli cluster create` to create the cluster.
+
----
 $ tscli cluster create <release-number>.tar.gz
----

== Lean configuration

*(For use with thin provisioning only)* If you have a xref:cloud.adoc#use-small-and-medium-instance-types-when-applicable[small or medium instance type], with less than 100GB of data, advanced lean configuration is required before loading any data into ThoughtSpot.
After installing the cluster, contact xref:contact.adoc[ThoughtSpot Support] for assistance with this configuration.
