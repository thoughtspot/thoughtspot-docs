= Stop Word Reference

ThoughtSpot recognizes a defined list of 'helper' words; we call them stop words.

SearchIQ is in [.label.label-beta]#Beta#.

NOTE: SearchIQ is turned off by default.
ThoughtSpot Support can enable it for you.
SearchIQ is only available in English.

This reference lists the various stop words that ThoughtSpot recognizes as normal parts of the language (articles, prepositions, conjunctions, and interjections).
Specifically, SearchIQ uses uses stop words in its descriptive columns.

When training SearchIQ Data Optimization, we recommend training worksheets with questions that contain only the following:

* Exact column names or their synonyms
* Exact values (for filtering)
* Keywords
* Stop words
