Status::
  The status of the release line.

  Pending;; The new release line has not been released.
  Limited;; We released the initial version in the release line, and we are with our partners in the _Early Adopter_ program to improve the new features. The Limited Release window is three (3) months.
  Active;; We are actively improving and supporting the new line that is already GA, and hardening the performance of the new functionality. The Active window is four (4) months.
  Maintenance;; When the release line is in maintenance mode, there are no improvements in the functionality of features, only security updates. The Maintenance window is five (5) months.
  Sunset;; When we stop support for a release line, at End of Life (EOL). This date is twelve (12) months after the start of the Limited Release.

Limited Release::
  This the date we release our first version of the product that changes the *minor* release number. This release is not generally available, and we distribute it only to our select partners. In the following three months, we work with our partners to validate and confirm new features and affordances of the product. An example of a Limited Release is 6.3.0, 7.0.0, and 7.1.0.

GA Date::
  The General Availability (GA) of a release line is three (3) months after its Limited Release. The GA of a release line is 6.3.1, 7.0.1, and 7.1.1. The GA release puts the release line into *active* status, which lasts four (4) months.
////
  *ThoughtSpot 7.0 SW*;; GA date for our Software (On-Prem) offering is when we make it available for installation or upgrade.
  *ThoughtSpot 7.0 CL*;; GA date for our Cloud (SaaS) offering is when we announce the new release of our start upgrading our service clusters.
////

Maintenance::
  After the next release line reaches its GA date, the current line enters the maintenance period. For example, the GA of 7.1 line (7.1.1 release) is in June 2021. This is the same date that the 6.3 line enters the maintenance window. In this phase, we only add critical security patches. The maintenance window lasts five (5) months.

End of Life (EOL)::
  This is the termination date for the maintenance window, when we completely stop support for the release line. The EOL is twelve (12) months  after the Limited Release date.

== Version policy

Each ThoughtSpot component has the following version signature: _major_._minor_._patch_.

Major::
  Major releases introduce substantial changes in features and functionality. They may also have advances that break backward compatibility, and deprecate large groups of related features. ThoughtSpot increments the major release number with the first release line of each calendar year. Releases within the same major release line maintain feature compatibility and API compatibility. An example of a major release change is the publication of the 7.0.0 release.

Minor::
  Minor releases add new features, improve the existing features and introduce fixes that maintain backward compatibility. ThoughtSpot increments its minor release every four (4) months. An example of a minor release change is the publication of the 7.1.0 release.

Patch::
  Patch releases fix issues found in the product, and maintain backward compatibility. They also signal the move of the release line from *limited availability* to *general availability*. An example of a patch release change is the publication of the 7.1.1 release.
+
After the publication of the first patch release, _X_._Y_.1, patch releases don't have a set schedule. Instead, we release patches for these reasons:
+
* Patches for customers who need an urgent correction to a feature
* Security patches

////
Prerelease::
  _*This is just a suggestion.*_
+
Major and minor releases may include prerelease versions, such as:
+
`_major_._minor_._patch_[-alpha._n_|-beta._n_|-rc._n_]`
//Prerelease versions will be tagged as next so that the npm client doesnâ€™t prefer a prerelease over a stable version. Once a release candidate (rc) has been thoroughly tested, the stable release will be published.
////

== Roadmap

_*This is just a suggestion; we may not wish to include this section at all, or keep it at a very high level.*_

Refer to ThoughtSpot's external product roadmap _*insert link here*_ for the list of features in active development or planned for future major and minor releases.

These proposed features, their scope, and the release timeframes are estimates, not firm commitments. These milestones are intended for informational purposes only.
