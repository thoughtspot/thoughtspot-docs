Learn how to set key formats for column values.  You can set number, date, and currency display formats.

These formats define how these value types display in tables and charts.

== Number formats

You can set a format for how numbers are displayed in tables and charts.
For example, you can display numbers with a different number of digits after the decimal point, based on the data modeling setting *Format Pattern*.
You can use any of the supported number formats for delimiters and number of digits to show using http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/text/DecimalFormat.html[Java Decimal Notation,window="_blank"].
Currency symbols are not supported.

The system has default values which are:

[cols=2*]
|===
| `#,###`
| For integer data types `INT` and `BIGINT`.
As you can see, these can only contain numbers, alpha characters are not permitted.

| `#,###.00`
| for decimal data types `DOUBLE` and `FLOAT`.
|===

These are some examples of formats you can use:

|===
| Stored Value | Format Pattern | Display Value

| 12345.6789
| `#,##0.##`
| 12,345.68

| 12345.6789
| `#,##0.###`
| 12,345.679

| 12345.6789
| `#,##0.00000`
| 12,345.68

| 12345.6789
| `#,##0`
| 12,345

| 12345.6789
| `#,##0.00`
| 12,345.68

| 12345
| `#,##0.##`
| 12,345

| 12345
| `#,##0.00`
| 12,345.00

You can change the date format used to display a column's values xref:model-data-ui.adoc[for a single table] or, by editing the data model, for xref:edit-model-file.adoc[the entire ThoughtSpot instance].
Editing the data model file requires that you have administrative privileges.

. Decide if the change is for a table or the entire instance.
. Find the *Format Pattern* for the column.
+
This is either a column in a single table or a column in the data modeling file.

. In the column, enter the format you want to use.
. Save your changes.
+
If you are using a data-modeling file you must upload the new file to your installation.

=== Profile-based number formatting

Number formatting is set by default based on your ThoughtSpot profile's *Preferred locale* setting.
You can set this value to accommodate your geographic locations.

For example, if you are using ThoughtSpot in the US, the number formatting should look like this: `xxx,xxx.xx`.
And in Europe, it should look like this: `xxx.xxx,xx`.

== Date formats

*Format Pattern* (UI)/ *Format Pattern* (model file) formats for how dates are displayed in tables and charts.
For example, you can display dates in a standard European or US format based on the data modeling setting *Format Pattern*.
These are some examples of formats you can use:

include::partial$data-modeling-strings.adoc[]

To change the date format used to display a column's values xref:model-data-ui.adoc[for a single table] or, by editing the data model, for xref:edit-model-file.adoc[the entire ThoughtSpot instance].

. Decide if the change is for a table or the entire instance.
. Find the *Format Pattern* for the column.
+
This is either a column in a single table or a column in the data modeling file.

. In the column, enter the format you want to use.
. Save your changes.
+
If you are using a data-modeling file you must upload the new file to your installation.

== Set currency type

You can set a format for how currencies display in tables and charts when using the ThoughtSpot Data API or embedding.
For example, you can display currencies in a standard European Euro or US Dollar format, based on the data modeling setting *Currency Type*.

You can change the currency format used to display a column's values xref:model-data-ui.adoc[for a single table].
When you specify the currency type of your data in the *Columns* settings, your currency data will only display the correct format and currency code in the embedded use case.
Currency specific symbols are available in the non-embedded use case as well, but they are not localized.

All users are treated as if they are in `en-US` locale unless they are in embed mode and their browser configuration tells ThoughtSpot that they are in some other locale.
For example, `100 Polish Zloty` appears as `100zł` to a user in Poland, but without localization enabled, it appears as `PLN 100`.

This subtle difference can be seen when you use the REST API.
See the ThoughtSpot Application Integration Guide for more information on the API.

. Find the *Currency Type* for the column whose display format you want to change.
. Click it to open the *Specify Currency Type* menu.

. Select one of the following ways you would like to change the format.

|===
| Option | Description

| *Infer From Browser*
| Your currency data will be modeled upon the locale of your browser setting.

| *From a column*
| Your currency data will be modeled upon the existing currency information in the selected column.
This option is disabled if there is no `VARCHAR` column to choose from.

| *Specify ISO Code*
| Your currency data will be modeled upon your selection from the available currency code choices.
