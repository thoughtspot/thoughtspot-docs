[#6-2-1-new]
== 6.2.1 New Features and Functionality

For a complete list of issues that we fixed in this release, see xref:fixed.adoc#6-2-1[6.2.1 Fixed issues].

=== For the IT Ops Engineer

Granular access to Pinboards:: Starting with this release, you can control user's permissions to create or update Pinboards, essentially limiting them to 'read only' access. These users can view and explore Pinboards.
However, they cannot edit, copy, download, or share Pinboards and Answers.
+
This must be enabled on the cluster.
+
See xref:pinboard-granular-permission.adoc[Granular access to Pinboards], and xref:about-privileges-end-user.adoc#read-only[Cannot create or update Pinboards] privilege.

Style customization::
You can now customize the ThoughtSpot application from the Admin Console.
With style customization, you can change the fonts, chart color palettes, footer text, application logo, and background colors in your embedded ThoughtSpot instance.
+
Refer to xref:style-customization.adoc[Style customization].

High cardinality::

In this release, ThoughtSpot supports charts and tables with a very large number of data values, and shows how much of the data your chart or table displays.

* Your search in table form can now have more than 1000 rows.
* Your charts now come with a horizontal scroll bar, to support up to 35,000 data points.
* You can have up to 250 distinct legend items on a chart.

++++
+
See xref:high-cardinality.adoc[Charts and tables with a very large number of data values].

New search keywords and changed behavior::

* *The nested '`top`' keyword*
+
The new keyword phrase, xref:keywords.adoc#top-n-by[top _n_ _measure1_ by _attribute_ | _measure2_], enables you to search the top n results by an attribute or a secondary measure.
* *The '`not in`' keyword*
+
Another keyword phrase, xref:keywords.adoc#not-in[not in], enables you to find the relative complement of two sets: results that satisfy the outer query that are not in the inner query.
Contrast this with xref:keywords.adoc#in[in] that returns results that are an intersection of the outer and inner query, or 'query within a query'.
* *Change in behavior for the '`in`' keyword*
+
The xref:keywords.adoc#in[in] keyword returns results that are an intersection of the outer and inner query, or 'query within a query'.
Starting in 6.2, searches with the `in` keyword do not include \{null} values.
To include these \{null} values, create a formula for the relevant attribute in your search, to convert \{null} values to 'unknown,' or some similar word.
+

Monitor [.label.label-beta]#Beta#::

* *Subscribe others*: To drive adoption of Pinboards, analysts can now subscribe business users to receive daily email notification for the relevant metrics.
See xref:monitor-headlines.adoc#subscribe-others[Subscribe others].
* *UI enhancements*: We made several improvements to the Monitor and Follow features, optimizing the workflow.+++</dlentry>++++++<dlentry id="insights">+++Insights::::
Insights no longer appear on Home page and Pinboard by default, unless that feature is turned on for the cluster.
See xref:about-navigating-thoughtspot.adocinsights[Finding your way around], Insights.

Scriptability::
This release introduces expanded support for xref:scriptability.adoc[exporting and importing ThoughtSpot objects].
You can now export and import the following scriptable objects:

* xref:worksheet-export.adoc[Worksheets with filters]
* xref:scriptability-answer.adoc[Answers] [.label.label-beta]#Beta#
* xref:scriptability-pinboard.adoc[Pinboards] [.label.label-beta]#Beta#

Aggregate formulas as Worksheet filters::
You can now use an aggregate formula as a Worksheet filter.
See xref:aggregation-formulas.adoc#aggregate-filter[Use aggregate formulas as Worksheet filters].

Formula Parser Improvements::
ThoughtSpot 6.2 includes improvements to the latency of the formula parser.
Complex formulas that took over 45 seconds to parse are now parsed in 150 milliseconds -- a 300x improvement.
Latency no longer increases exponentially with the depth of the formula nesting, no matter how complex the formula is.

=== For the Business User
Growth: Sharing:: Updates to xref:sharing-for-end-users.adoc[sharing] in 6.2 make the feature more intuitive, and remove moments of friction that can occur when sharing, or trying to access objects for which you have limited permissions.

* *xref:share-pinboards.adoc#share-viz[Share a specific visualization within a Pinboard]* so that the email link opens up to that visualization in Explore mode
* *xref:share-pinboards.adoc#share-direct-link[Copy a direct link to the Pinboard, Answer, or visualization within a Pinboard]* that you are sharing, so you can separately send that link to users after you share the object with them
* *xref:request-access[Request access within a Pinboard or Answer]* if you need edit or underlying data access to the Pinboard or Answer
* *xref:share-pinboards.adoc#share-underlying-data[Share underlying data access]* within the sharing modal if the user does not have data access

Answer Explorer v2::
Updates to Answer Explorer in 6.2 introduce a cleaner user interface and allow users to add their own filters, comparisons, measures, and attributes to a visualization while in Explore mode.
See xref:answer-explorer.adoc[Answer Explorer] for more information.

In-memory data compression::
ThoughtSpot release 6.2 includes improvements to in-memory data compression.
These improvements lower your RAM requirements and reduce the number of VMs you need for in-memory data, when deploying on a cloud platform.
In release 6.2, ThoughtSpot added two new compression algorithms to the Dictionary compression that ThoughtSpot already supports.
ThoughtSpot now supports *LZ4*, for `INT`, `BIGINT`, `DOUBLE`, and `FLOAT` data types, and *RLE*, for strings.
See xref:data-compression.adoc[In-memory data compression] for more information.

Falcon monitoring Pinboards::
In ThoughtSpot release 6.2, there are 4 new Pinboards, based on Falcon metrics, that are available to system administrators.
Use the Falcon monitoring system Pinboards for an overview of Falcon, ThoughtSpot's in-memory database, and its health, based on query, data load, and varz metrics.
You can use these Pinboards for proactive monitoring, or, with help from xref:contact.adoc[ThoughtSpot Support], for debugging.
See xref:falcon-monitor.adoc[Falcon monitoring Pinboards] for more information.

In-app acceptance of ThoughtSpot's use agreement::
You can now sign ThoughtSpot's end-user use agreement from the application itself.
Even if you previously signed a paper copy of the use agreement, an admin *_must_* sign the agreement in the application, within 30 days of your upgrade to release 6.2.
See xref:use-agreement.adoc[ThoughtSpot use agreement] for more information.
