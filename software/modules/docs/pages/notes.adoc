Linked Pinboard filters::
  You can now create one filter that filters visualizations based on multiple Worksheets by linking the Worksheet columns, at the Pinboard level.
+
This is useful when you have a Pinboard built on multiple Worksheets, and you would like to filter on columns that are functionally the same, but exist in multiple Worksheets.
Refer to xref:linked-filters.adoc[Linked Pinboard filters].

[#selective-filters]
Selective Pinboard filters::
  You can now configure Pinboard filters to apply to specific visualizations that you choose.
+
This is useful when you would like to filter some, but not all, visualizations in a Pinboard. Refer to xref:selective-filters.adoc[Selective Pinboard filters].

[#6-3-business-user]

We also made this feature available in ThoughtSpot release 6.0.5.

[#open-ldap-admin-user]
OpenLDAP admin user::
  ThoughtSpot now supports using your company's OpenLDAP admin user to SSH into your cluster(s) as an admin, instead of using the local ThoughtSpot admin user, which has sudo privileges.
+
This feature is only applicable to ThoughtSpot clusters that run on an xref:rhel.html[RHEL image]. Refer to xref:rhel-install-online.adoc#ldap_admin_user[Install the ThoughtSpot application on online clusters that use RHEL] to learn how to add the three OpenLDAP admin user parameters to your Ansible playbook.

User adoption and performance Pinboards::
  This release of ThoughtSpot contains two new default Pinboards for administrators.
+
* Use the *User Adoption Pinboard* in the *Admin Console* to understand how your ThoughtSpot users are interacting with ThoughtSpot, and how your user adoption is changing over time.
* Use the Performance Tracking Pinboard, accessible from the *Pinboards* tab, to understand how your ThoughtSpot cluster performs.
+
See the xref:admin-portal-user-adoption-pinboard.adoc[User Adoption Pinboard] and xref:performance-tracking.adoc[Performance Tracking Pinboard].

[#ease-of-installation]
RHEL and Amazon Linux 2 ease of installation::

+
* You can now use a Terraform, Puppet, or Chef template, or an Ansible tarball, to install OS packages, dependencies, and the ThoughtSpot CLI (tscli), and configure your cluster. Previously, you could only use an Ansible tarball or Terraform template.
