= Delete a connection
:last_updated: 11/18/2019


Learn how to delete a connection.

A connection is not tied to a task, and can therefore be called in multiple data sources.
So in order to delete a connection, you must first delete all of the sources and tasks that use that connection.
When the connection is not used in any data source, you can delete it.

To delete a connection:

. Log in to ThoughtSpot from a browser.
. Click *Data*, on the top navigation bar.
. Click the *Data Sources* tab at the top of the screen.
