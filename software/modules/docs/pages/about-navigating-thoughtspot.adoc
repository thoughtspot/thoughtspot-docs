ThoughtSpot is organized into several sections to make navigation easy. You can reach them by using the menu bar.

These are the different sections in ThoughtSpot:

== Home

Click the ThoughtSpot logo to go to the application home page.
At the top of the home page you can see a search bar, and several areas that show activity in ThoughtSpot.
[width="100%",options="header",cols="20%a,40%a,40%a",valign="top"]
|====================
| Label | Image | Description
| **All time popular**

**Recently trending** | image::home-trending.png[] | Shows all-time popular answers and pinboards, by number of views. You can choose between all-time popular, or recently in the last 15 days. Small icons illustrate the type of visualization you can find when you click an item.

| Recently viewed | image::home-recently-viewed.png[] | Answers and pinboards you've viewed recently.
| Recent team activity | image::home-team-activity.png[] | Answers, pinboards, worksheets, and tables people in your company have created or edited recently.
| Did you know? | image::home-spotiq.png[] |  Contains auto analysis results from SpotIQ. Off by default. After you turn on insights, they are visible only to users that have the SpotIQ privilege.
|====================

The **items** shown in these areas are limited to answers, pinboards, worksheets, and other objects you have access to.
For example, if you don't have the ability to use SpotIQ, that option does not appear.

[#search]
== Search

*Search* is where you will spend most of your time.
It allows you to search and explore your data.
Choose your data sources and type in the search bar at the top.
As you type your search, results will appear in the main part of the screen as either a table or a chart.

If SearchIQ [.label.label-beta]#Beta# is enabled by your administrator, this label is *Search+*, to differentiate it from SearchIQ.
Use the search bar on the homepage to use SearchIQ.

[#answers]
== Answers

Answers are the result of a single search.
You can save an answer you want to work more on later, or just keep it for your personal use.
Answers are for you alone, until you share them with others.

[#pinboards]
== Pinboards

Pinboards are collections of related search results.
You can create your own pinboard or add to an existing one.
After saving a pinboard, it can be shared with others or viewed as a slideshow.
The *Pinboards* page shows a list of saved pinboards.
Click one to view, edit, or share it.
