= Pie charts
:last_updated: 07-01-2019

A pie (or a circle) chart is a statistical graphic that divides data into slices to illustrate numerical proportion.
In a pie chart, the arc length of a slice is proportional to the quantity it represents.

The pie chart is a classic chart type that displays your search in a circle.
The default pie chart in ThoughtSpot displays data in the shape of a doughnut, or a thick ring.

== How pie charts divide data

Pie charts divide your data into sectors that each represent a proportion of a whole circle.
You can display the exact values of each slice, in addition to the percentage values by toggling on *Additional chart options* found under Change chart configuration.

Your search needs at least one attribute and one measure to be represented as a pie chart.
Also, there must be fewer than 50 values in the attribute column.

== Pie in pie charts

The pie in pie chart can be created from a regular pie chart in order to compare more than one component of an attribute.
Pie in pie charts show two concentric pie charts comparing different measures.

To see a pie in pie chart, assign two different measures to the y-axis under *Configure Chart*.
