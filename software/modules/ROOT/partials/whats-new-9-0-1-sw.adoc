[#9-0-0-sw-mandatory-filters]
[discrete]
=== Mandatory Liveboard filters

Mark certain filters in your Liveboard as mandatory. If you add mandatory filters to a Liveboard, the visualizations will only load after Liveboard viewers select values for the mandatory filters. Use mandatory filters for Liveboards that contain data that may not be relevant for everyone who must view and consume the Liveboard. Mandatory filters also lower query and performance costs. To try the feature out, select *Mandatory filter* when adding a filter to a Liveboard. This feature must be enabled by your administrator.

[#9-0-0-sw-pivot-measures]
[discrete]
=== Show measures in pivot table rows

By default, ThoughtSpot displays measures in columns in pivot tables. With this release, choose whether to display measures in rows or columns in your pivot tables. To try it out, in the chart configuration panel for a pivot table, select *Settings > Display measures in rows*.

[#9-0-0-sw-labels]
[discrete]
=== Data labels on a dark background

Labels that appear on a dark background can be displayed in a lighter text color, making them easier to read. To try it out, navigate to Search data and *Create a chart* > *Change the chart color*, and *Add labels*. This feature must be enabled by your administrator.

[#9-0-0-sw-rename]
[discrete]
=== Rename Liveboards and visualizations in view mode

Change the name or description of a Liveboard or visualization from view mode. The more image:icon-more-10px.png[more menu icon] menu for Liveboards and Liveboard visualizations now includes a *Rename* option, where you can edit the object name and description. To try it out, navigate to a Liveboard, and select the more image:icon-more-10px.png[more menu icon] menu for a visualization.

[#9-0-0-sw-chart-config-apply]
[discrete]
=== Apply multiple chart changes at once

When a user drags and drops the fields in the chart configuration panel, the chart reloads. When a user has multiple fields, they need to rearrange a lot of them to reach a desired chart. Now users can make multiple configurations, and apply them all at once, rather than waiting in between each configuration. To try it out, click *Apply* in the chart configuration panel of edit chart. This feature must be enabled by your administrator.

[#9-0-0-sw-profile]
[discrete]
=== Edit display name from profile
You can now edit your display name by clicking the profile icon in the upper-right corner of the screen and clicking on the *Edit* button next to *Name*.

// Naomi-- behind a flag

Previously, when using group_aggregate formulas, users could use query_filters to include filters entered in the search bar in the formula's value, but it was difficult to write a formula that accepted filters from only a single column.

Starting with this release, you can specify column names within the ‘filters’ section of a group_aggregate formula, and any filter in your search bar referencing that column will be added to the formula. Filters entered in the search bar that are not on columns specified in the third argument of the group_aggregate formula will be ignored.

Create Worksheet parameters to optimize your data inquiries. Use parameters to run different scenarios with adjustable values, without creating or modifying the constants in formulas for each new value. For example, easily adjust the attribute in an Answer to view your revenue by commit date or order date, as in the following gif. To try it out, edit a Worksheet, and select the *+* button that appears when you hover over the *Parameters* section.

[#9-0-0-sw-custom-map]
[discrete]
=== Upload custom geo maps

Upload your own custom maps and visualize data on geo charts with regions that are specific to you and your organization. To try it out, select *Custom maps* in the Admin Console. This feature must be enabled by your administrator.

[#9-0-0-sw-postgresql]

=== PostgreSQL connection

// Naomi

You can now create connections from ThoughtSpot to PostgreSQL.

[#9-0-0-sw-connection-share]
[discrete]
=== Sharing connections

// Naomi

You can now share connections with other users or groups. Once granted access to a connection, users can add, remove, and modify tables in that connection.

[#9-0-0-sw-dbt-meta]
[discrete]
=== dbt metadata tags for tables and Worksheets

Manage your ThoughtSpot table and Worksheet column properties and table joins in dbt by using metadata tags to define column properties and joins within your dbt model schema. Your dbt models contain all the necessary information, and you don't have to manually update the columns in ThoughtSpot when you make changes to your dbt model. To try it out, update the `.yml` schema files for your dbt models with the new metadata tags.

[#9-0-0-sw-tags]
[discrete]
=== Tag enhancements

This release includes the following updates to the tags feature in the Data workspace:

* Add tags to multiple objects at a time
* Administrators can create new tags from the *Edit tags* modal

To try it out, select an object in the Data Workspace, and select *Edit tags*.

[#9-0-0-sw-fqn]
[discrete]
=== Include FQNs when exporting TML files

To reduce ambiguity when exporting TML files, you can export the fully qualified names (FQNs) for the objects' data sources. If you select this option, the TML file contains FQNs for the underlying tables and connections. To try it out, select *Export FQNs of referenced objects* when exporting TML files.

image::tml-export-fqn.png[Choose what to export modal with the export fqn option highlighted]

[#9-0-0-sw-tml-guids]
[discrete]
=== Visualization GUID support in TML files

Liveboard ThoughtSpot Modeling Language (TML) files now contain distinct GUIDs for each visualization in the Liveboard by default. This ensures that the GUID for the visualization stays the same after you import or export it. To try it out, select the *Export TML* menu option for a Liveboard.

[#9-0-0-sw-joins-rls]
[discrete]
=== Delete joins and RLS rules through TML

When you edit and import table TML files, ThoughtSpot now supports deletion of joins at the table level and row-level security (RLS) rules. To try it out, delete the lines in a table TML file that contain RLS rules or joins, and import the object.

[#9-0-0-sw-detail-options]
[discrete]
=== Delete or make a copy of objects from the details page

Delete or make a copy of Worksheets and Views from an object's details page. To try it out, open any Worksheet or View, and select the more menu image:icon-more-10px.png[more menu icon image].

[#9-0-0-sw-table-delete]
[discrete]
=== Delete tables from ThoughtSpot

// Naomi

Previously, when deleting tables from Connections, ThoughtSpot did not delete the table’s metadata completely. Now, tables deleted through the ThoughtSpot UI disappear completely from your cluster.

[#9-0-0-sw-python]
[discrete]
=== Python 3.9 upgrade
Python 3.9 is now the default Python version for all ThoughtSpot Software clusters, regardless of deployment type. ThoughtSpot does not support any other Python release for clusters on ThoughtSpot release 9.0.0.sw and later.

[#9-0-0-sw-rhel-deploy]
[discrete]
=== Deploy ThoughtSpot on RHEL, OEL, or Amazon Linux 2 using your LDAP or AD service account
When deploying ThoughtSpot on RHEL, OEL, or Amazon Linux 2, you can use your LDAP or Active Directory service account for installation, instead of using a local user.


[#9-0-0-sw-early-access]
[discrete]
=== Early Access features
Administrators can see the available Early Access features and selectively enable or disable them for all users. To try it out, go to the *Admin* tab and select *Early Access features*.
