[#group_aggregate]
group_aggregate::
  Takes a measure and optional attributes and filters. Used
to aggregate measures with different granularities and filters than the columns used in the search. Commonly used in comparison analysis.

This formula takes the following form:

`group_aggregate (<aggregation(measure)>, <groupings>, <filters>)`
+
Define lists using curly brackets, `{ }`. Optional list functions `query_groups` or `query_filters` specify the lists or filters used in the original search. Use `+` (plus) and `-` (minus) to add or exclude specific columns for query groups.
+
