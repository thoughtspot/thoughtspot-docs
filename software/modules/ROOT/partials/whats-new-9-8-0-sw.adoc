=== Contextual change analysis: More insights

// Mary -- scal-172513, scal-152750

When running change analysis, you can now see additional insights. For example, ThoughtSpot will detect values that underwent the highest percentage change between the two data points defined in your analysis, and values whose share of the total changed the most. The additional insights appear below the main analysis in the change analysis pop-up window. Note that insights do not appear for measures of type `unique counts` and `ratios`.

[#9-8-0-sw-literacy]
[discrete]
=== Multi-date bucketing

// Mary -- scal-154154, scal-174031

Previously, when adding multiple date keywords to a Search, ThoughtSpot accepted the last entered date keyword as the bucket. For example, if you searched for `revenue` `monthly` `yearly`, ThoughtSpot would interpret `monthly` as `month of year`, rather than using the `monthly` bucket.

Now, when you add multiple date keywords to a Search, ThoughtSpot preserves the date bucketing implied by the first date keyword. If you would like to change the default date bucket, you can use the *more options* menu for the column and select *Time Bucket* for more options. For more information, see

// Naomi -- scal-161857, SCAL-160779

We made the following enhancements to verified Liveboards:

- When you request verification, you can now see the underlying data sources that will be shared with the verifier.
- The name of the Liveboard now appears in verification request emails.
- When editing an Answer on or pinning an Answer to a verified Liveboard, a warning banner appears indicating it may need to be verified again.

[#9-8-0-sw-liveboards]

=== Functional enhancements for verified Liveboards

// Mary -- scal-158469

You can now easily search for verified Liveboards with trusted content, and filter to view only verified content. Verified Liveboards are identified with a tag visible in all screens. You can also cancel verification requests when needed. For more information, see

=== Hidden columns in tables

// Naomi -- scal-154258


You can now hide a column from your table without removing it from your current Search. If you hide the column you’re using to sort results, the sorting order is unchanged. To try it out, create an Answer, open the chart configuration menu gear icon, and drag the selected column to *Hidden Columns*. For more information, see

You can now see the state of query execution for any Liveboard visualization while it loads. If a visualization takes longer than three seconds to load, ThoughtSpot displays the current query execution status (executing query, waiting for connection, or processing query) to help users identify the reason for the delay.

=== Embedding in note tiles

// Mary -- scal-165262, scal-158410

Embedding in note tiles is now available to all users and is on by default. You can now embed interactive content such as videos, pdfs, or Figma files into Liveboards using the note tile format. To try it out, enter a Liveboard, select the edit icon, and select *Add note* from the top bar. You can then click the embed icon and enter the URL or iFrame code for your content. You can interact with the content embedded in a Liveboard like you would with a website. For more information, see

[#9-8-0-sw-personalized]
[discrete]
=== Personalized Liveboard views

// Mary -- scal-66335, scal-163617

Personalized views are now available to all users and on by default. Personalized views allow you to save your own set of values for filters and parameters in a Liveboard. You can change the values of the already present filters and parameters in a Liveboard and save the view for future use. Any changes made to the master Liveboard are carried over to the view, including changes made to pinned visualizations, tabs, filter chips, and re-ordering. Changes made to the view are not pushed to the master Liveboard. This eliminates the need to make multiple copies of a Liveboard with your preferred filter values, that can fall out of sync with the original. For more information, see

[#9-8-0-sw-dbt]
[discrete]
=== dbt enhancements

// Naomi -- scal-157152, scal-149212, scal-119947, scal-132902

We made the following changes to dbt:

* Previously, when a Worksheet was created from a dbt model, the default worksheet join rule was "apply all joins". Now, "apply joins progressively" is the default. This means that when a Search is done on the Worksheet, joins are applied as each search term is added, rather than applying all joins to every Search.

* In the past, ThoughtSpot generated a new Worksheet every time a user edited an existing dbt data model. Now, ThoughtSpot maintains a persistent connection with dbt and provides realtime updates. Users can update an object, update an object and create a new object, or simply create a new object.
For more information, see
ifndef::pendo-links[]
xref:dbt-integration.adoc[Integrate with dbt].
endif::[]
ifdef::pendo-links[]
xref:dbt-integration.adoc[Integrate with dbt,window=_blank].

* ThoughtSpot now supports dbt version 1.6.
