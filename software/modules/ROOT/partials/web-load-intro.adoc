You can load data through the Web browser for small tables (under 50MB) with simple relationships between them.
This method is not recommended for large, repeating data loads.
Using this method, the data schema is created for you automatically.

Any user who belongs to a group that has the privilege *Has administration privileges* or *Can upload user data* can upload their own data from the browser.

Your data should be in a CSV (comma separated values) before you load it.
A CSV file is a text file made up of data fields separated by a delimiter and optionally enclosed with an enclosing character.
If your data contains multiple tables, you can have a separate CSV for each table.
