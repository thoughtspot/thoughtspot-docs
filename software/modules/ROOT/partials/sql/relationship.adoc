RELATIONSHIP:: Defines a relationship where the value(s) in the first table can join to a second table, using a _required_ equality condition and one or more _optional_ range conditions. These conditions act like a `WHERE` clause when the two tables are joined. The conditions combine using `AND` logic; all conditions must be met for a row to be in the result.
+
You may add multiple relationships between tables. When creating a relationship, name it. You can reference the relationship by name later, if you want to remove it.
