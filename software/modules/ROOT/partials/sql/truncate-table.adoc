TRUNCATE TABLE <table>:: Removes all data from a table, but preserves its metadata, including all GUIDs, relationships, and so on. Use this command to force a new schema for a table  without losing the metadata.
+
CAUTION: This operation removes all existing data from the table. You must reload the data after a `TRUNCATE` command, or all dependent objects (worksheets and pinboards) in [.ph]#ThoughtSpot# become invalid.
