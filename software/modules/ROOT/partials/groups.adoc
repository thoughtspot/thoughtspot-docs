Before people can log in and use ThoughtSpot, you need to create a username, a password, and a membership in one or more groups for them.
Use the Admin Console to easily create and manage your user groups.

Refer to xref:groups-privileges.adoc[Understand groups and privileges] to learn about the privileges you can assign to a user or group.

To manage groups, navigate to the Admin Console by clicking on the *Admin* tab from the top navigation bar.
Select *Groups* from the side navigation bar that appears.

You can use the Admin Console to accomplish the following tasks:

* *Create a group* by clicking on the *+ add group* button
* *Manage an existing group* by clicking on the group you would like to edit: change the group or display name, update the sharing visibility, add a description, edit the group's privileges, change the group's default Pinboard, add an existing group to the group, add a user to the group, or resend or test the welcome email
* *Delete a group* by hovering over a group name, clicking the checkbox that appears, and selecting the *Delete* button

NOTE: ThoughtSpot adds external users, or users that authenticate through SAML or Active Directory, to the *all* group by default.
This group has no privileges.
You must manually assign users to ThoughtSpot groups to give them privileges, such as *can upload user data*, or *can manage data*.
