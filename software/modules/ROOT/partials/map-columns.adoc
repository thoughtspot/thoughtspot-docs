To map the columns of the external tables to columns in ThoughtSpot's internal tables:

. Scroll down to the *Map the columns...* section.
. Specify the following information for columns:
+
 .. Select (or deselect) *columns* for syncing into ThoughtSpot. +
By default, all columns are selected.
 .. *Search* for columns by name;
this is very useful for very wide tables.
 .. *Rename* columns in the ThoughtSpot table, for easier search. +
To make this change, click the pencil (edit) icon next to the name of the column.
 .. *Change the data type* of the column inside the ThoughtSpot table. +
Click the down chevron icon to open the drop-down menu, and select a new data type. +
For example, if you know you have integer data, change the default *DOUBLE* datatype to *INT32*.
 .. Set *Primary keys* of the table by toggling the selector to the 'on' position. +
Note that several columns may be primary keys.
 .. Set the *Sharding keys* of the table by toggling the selector to the 'on' position.
 .. Specify the *Number of shards* in the table.
 .. Use *Add new formula* to transform your data before loading it into ThoughtSpot.
Add logic to incorporate a frequently-used or complex formula at data ingestion, so ThoughtSpot doesn't re-calculate it in every Answer and Liveboard. +
Formulas support all row-level native database functions;
we do not support aggregate functions.

  *** Click *Add new formula*.
  *** In the *Add new formula* interface, name the formula and then build it by specifying the functions, columns, and parameters.
Note that the support for functions depends on the support by the native database.
  *** Click *Add* to finalize the formula.
Notice this adds it to the list of mapped columns.
. Save your work by clicking *Save*. +
Alternatively, click *Save and sync now* to save your work and sync data at the same time.
