== Creating additional configurations for your {connection} connection

When you create your {connection} connection, you enter a default configuration. You can create additional configurations for your {connection} connection. With additional configurations you can do the following:

- Configure a separate Snowflake warehouse for specific ThoughtSpot users or groups, eliminating the need to duplicate Liveboards and configure multiple Snowflake connections. This can help you with cost tracking and chargeback.
- Use a different configuration, including Snowflake warehouse, for your search indexing so that you can control and balance the computing load.
- Test a set of Liveboards against different environments (dev, qa, prod), and configure different Snowflake warehouses for multi-tenancy / multi-Org deployments.

Creating additional configurations for your {connection} connection is an Early Access feature and is disabled by default. To enable it, contact your ThoughtSpot administrator. For more about Early Access features, see xref:release-lifecycle.adoc#early-access[ThoughtSpot Cloud release life cycle].

To create an additional configuration for your {connection} connection, do the following:

. Select *Data* in the top navigation bar.
. Open the *Connections* tab in the left navigation bar.

The connection is validated by ThoughtSpot and then the _Describe your configuration_ window appears.
. Create a name and (optional) description of your configuration, and click *Continue*.

Your additional configuration is complete and appears below your connection's name on the Connections page.
