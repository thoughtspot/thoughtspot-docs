[#ts_groups]
ts_groups::
  Returns a list of all the groups the current logged-in user belongs to. For any row, if the expression evaluates to `true` for any of the groups, the user can see that row.
Example;;
+
----
ts_groups = 'east'
----

[#ts_username]
ts_username::
  Returns the user with the matching name.
Example;;
+
----
ts_username != 'mark'

NOTE: You cannot use these variables (`ts_groups` and `ts_username`) within an expression. For example, `ts_groups = substr(rls_group_name, 0, 3)` is valid, but `substr(ts_groups,0,3) = rls_group_name` is NOT valid.
