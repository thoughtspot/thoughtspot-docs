== Configure SMTP through the Admin Console

You can set up the relay host for SMTP from the Admin Console.

NOTE: If you would like to use a custom port, rather than the default, port 25, you must configure SMTP using `tscli`, by running `tscli smtp set-relayhost <IP_address>:<custom_port>`.

=== Set up relay host

Navigate to the Admin Console by clicking on the *Admin* tab from the top navigation bar.
Select *SMTP* from the side navigation bar that appears.
