You can now identify the key change drivers for changes in your metrics in a KPI chart. Select the percent change label or select any two data points on the KPI sparkline to view change analysis on your top 5 columns by usage-based ranking (UBR) and identify the reason behind the observed change. You can view the changes in other columns by clicking *Manage attributes* and selecting the desired column(s).

Mandatory Liveboard filters are now GA. Mark certain filters in your Liveboard as mandatory. If you add mandatory filters to a Liveboard, the visualizations will only load after Liveboard viewers select values for the mandatory filters. Use mandatory filters for Liveboards that contain data that may not be relevant for everyone who must view and consume the Liveboard. Mandatory filters also lower query and performance costs.

=== Specify default connection for CSV uploads
Previously, when multiple database connections were configured to receive CSV uploads without a specified table or worksheet for collocation, the files were randomly uploaded to one of the connections. With this new enhancement, administrators and data managers now have the ability to specify a default target connection for such uploads. +
To set the default target connection, navigate to *Data > Connections*, click the *More* menu icon image:icon-more-10px.png[menu icon], select *Configure data upload*, and click the *Enable data upload* toggle to on. Next, select the *Set as default CSV upload destination* toggle. By specifying a default connection, you ensure that CSV files without a designated destination will be uploaded to the chosen connection.
This enhancement provides better control and organization of CSV uploads, making it easier to manage data in scenarios where end-users do not select a co-location for their uploaded files.

// Naomi

Group aggregate filter enhancements are GA and on by default. Previously, when using group_aggregate formulas, users could use query_filters to include filters entered in the search bar in the formula's value, but it was difficult to write a formula that accepted filters from only a single column.

Starting with this release, you can specify column names within the ‘filters’ section of a group_aggregate formula, and any filter in your search bar referencing that column will be added to the formula. Filters entered in the search bar that are not on columns specified in the third argument of the group_aggregate formula will be ignored. For details, see

=== Group aggregate enhancements: reaggregation [.badge.badge-beta]#Beta#
endif::[]

// Naomi


To reduce confusion when using aggregate formulas, the level of detail defined in group formulas is now respected at query level. For example, when trying to calculate the contribution of each store’s sales to the entire region, you might use a group_sum formula, where the sales at store level is divided by the sales at regional level. Your search would include the following columns: `Revenue`, `Customer nation`, `Regional Revenue formula`, and `Customer region`, where `Regional Revenue formula = group_sum(Revenue, Customer Region)`.

According to the old reaggregation behavior, if a customer removed `Customer region` from the search bar, the level of detail in the formula would no longer be respected and the formula’s denominator would re-aggregate up to the total. In this case, the formula result would display revenue as a percentage of total revenue, rather than as a percentage of regional revenue.

Under the new aggregation behavior, the formula result will continue to display revenue as a percentage of each region, even if you remove `Customer region` from the search bar. Visualizations will also display the correct aggregation even if the grouping column is not added to the X-axis.
