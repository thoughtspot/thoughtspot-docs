[#8-8-0-sw-headline-aggregation]
[discrete]
=== Headline summaries for discontinuous group aggregate formulas

// Naomi

We changed the default behavior for table aggregation summaries when the search contains a formulas that contain both a conditional clause (`if... then... else`) and a group_aggregate expression. When a user searches with a formula containing both a conditional clause and a group_aggregate expression, then ThoughtSpot detects the aggregation type on the first non-constant output clause and uses it in the headline summary. In this context, a non-constant output clause means any base column reference (for example, `Revenue`), or formula (for example, `sum(revenue)`).

For example, in the formula `group_aggregate(sum(if (Color = 'blue') then 0 else group_unique_count(Discount)))`, the headline summary would use `COUNT_DISTINCT`, since the first non-constant output clause within the `if... then... else` clause is `group_unique_count` and has an aggregation type of `COUNT_DISTINCT`.

For more information, see xref:chart-table.adoc[].

[#8-8-0-sw-show-underlying-data]

* When you open the *Edit columns* pop-up, you can now search for column names using the search bar.
* The *Show underlying data* pop-up no longer disables columns by default. To disable columns from your query, click *Edit columns* and deselect the column name(s).
