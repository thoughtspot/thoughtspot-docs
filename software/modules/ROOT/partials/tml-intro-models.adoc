Use TML to modify a ThoughtSpot object in a flat-file format. Then, migrate the object to a different cluster, or restore it to the same cluster.

To work with TML files for {object}, you can download these objects to flat files in `.model.tml` format, modify the files, and subsequently upload the files either to the same cluster, or to a different cluster.
To learn how to export, change, and update {object}, see xref:scriptability.adoc[Import and export TML files].

The syntax examples in this article contain every possible parameter in TML files for {object}.
Some of these parameters are not in these files by default.
If you want to use them, you must add them yourself.
For example, the `fqn` parameter is not present in any TML file by default, but you can add it to differentiate a table from another table with the same name.

As you work with TML files, keep in mind that changing elements of the TML file, such as the name of a column or table, may affect dependents. This is specifically true if you are editing TML files outside ThoughtSpot. When you change the name of a table in a TML file, and then import that file into ThoughtSpot, ThoughtSpot automatically updates that table name in any dependents, such as Answers that use the table as a data source. However, if you download multiple TML files from one ThoughtSpot cluster, then change the table name in TML, and upload all the files to a brand-new cluster, ThoughtSpot doesn't know that the dependents should use that table. You must also change the table name in the dependents.
