The system asks you to `tunnelrelay.thoughtspot.com` to your list of allowed domains, if you have not already.

If you have added `tunnelrelay.thoughtspot.com` to your list of allowed domains, by opening port `22`, the system allows you to enable or disable the reverse SSH tunnel.

Toggle **Enable** or **Disable** and select *Save*.
