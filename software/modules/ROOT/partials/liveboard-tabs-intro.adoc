You may want to separate your Liveboard into multiple tabs, grouping certain visualizations together in each tab. For example, you may have a *Sales* Liveboard that contains top-level KPIs and more detailed charts. You can create a tab for the top-level KPIs for executives to view, and a tab for the more detailed charts that managers need to monitor. To add tabs, select the *Edit* button at the upper right of the Liveboard, and select *+ Add tab* in the top menu.

The Liveboard tabs feature is part of the xref:liveboard-experience-new.adoc[new Liveboard experience], which is off by default. You can enable it xref:user-profile.adoc#new-liveboard-experience[from your profile].
