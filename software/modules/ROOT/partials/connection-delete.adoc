A connection can be used in multiple data sources or visualizations. Because of this, you must delete all data sources, answers, and pinboards that depend on the connection before you can delete it.

Follow these steps to delete an existing Databricks connection:

include::partial$connections-nav2.adoc[]

. Check the box next to the connection you want to delete.

. Click *Delete*.

. In the *Confirm delete* window, click *Delete* again.

. If you attempt to delete a connection with dependent objects, ThoughtSpot blocks the operation. A *Cannot delete* window appears, with a list of links to dependent objects.

. Click the link for each object to either modify it by removing the dependency on the connection, or delete it.

. To close the window, click *OK*.

. After you resolve the dependencies, you can delete the table.
