When you remap a connection, you can make the following  changes:

* Add, remove, or update a key-value pair.
* Remap a table.
* Rename a table.
* Re-point to a table, if using a different table in the external database.
* Remap a column.
* Rename a column, if the name of the column changed in the external database.
* Re-point to a column, if using a new or different column in the external database.
* Change the data type of a column.
+
NOTE: ThoughtSpot performs a compatibility check when changing the data type.
* Migrate from one warehouse to another.
+
For example, you can migrate from Snowflake to Redshift if you migrate the entire schema.

NOTE: You cannot change the authentication type through remapping.
