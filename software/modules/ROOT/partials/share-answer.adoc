You do not have to be an administrator or the owner of an answer to share saved answers.
Whenever you view an answer, you have the option of sharing it with others.
The answer appears in its most recent state when you share it.
For example, if you add a filter after saving the answer and then share it, the answer you share has that filter.

You can share an answer from the list of answers on the <<share-answers-page,main *Answers* page>>, or from <<share-answer,the answer itself>>.
