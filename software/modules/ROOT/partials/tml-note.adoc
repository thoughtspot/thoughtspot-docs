NOTE: Starting with ThoughtSpot release 6.3, ThoughtSpot Scriptable Worksheets are written in ThoughtSpot Modeling Language (TML). Files from version 6.3 and later have a `.tml` extension. However, you can import files from 6.2.1 and earlier, with a `.yaml` or `.tsl` extension, to 6.3 and later environments with no issue.
