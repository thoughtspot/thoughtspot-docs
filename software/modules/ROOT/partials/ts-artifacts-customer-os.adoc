For all (online and offline) deployments of ThoughtSpot on a customer-managed OS like RHEL, OEL, or Amazon Linux 2, you will need:

* The **Release tarball**, which contains the ThoughtSpot software binaries (`tar.gz`) of the release version you are installing or upgrading; for example, ThoughtSpot Release 8.8.1.sw.
* The **ansible tarball**, which contains a set of scripts for installing OS packages, dependencies, the ThoughtSpot CLI (tscli), and configuring your cluster (preparing the disks).
You can obtain these files from the https://thoughtspot.egnyte.com/[ThoughtSpot secure file sharing system^]. We sent your specific link to the secure file sharing system to you in our Welcome email. If you experience difficulties accessing these files, contact {support-url}. There are different ansible tarballs, depending on if you are installing ThoughtSpot in online clusters or offline clusters. The online ansible tarball is called `ansible`, and the offline tarball is called `ansible_offline`.

If your organization performs automation with a different configuration management tool, you can use the template ThoughtSpot developed for automation with Terraform. You can obtain this template from our https://github.com/thoughtspot/community-tools/tree/master/ThoughtSpot_Cloud_deployments/AWS/template_Homogeneous_cluster_ssm[GitHub repository^]. ThoughtSpot provides templates for these alternative tools only as generic guidelines. You should review the templates before using them and make sure that they are safe to use in your organization. In no way can ThoughtSpot be held responsible for any issue arising from their use.
