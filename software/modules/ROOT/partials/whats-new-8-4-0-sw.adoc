=== Key Performance Indicator (KPI) chart type

// Naomi

You can now create visualizations of your data’s Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). When you search for a measure with a time-related keyword (for example, `Sales weekly`), you can create sparkline visualizations of your data’s Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). ThoughtSpot also supports conditional formatting to add visual cues for KPIs or threshold metrics to easily show where you are falling short or exceeding targets. For more information, see xref:chart-kpi.adoc[]. +

=== Auto-select search data source for new users

When a new user uses Search Data, ThoughtSpot intelligently selects a data source for them to search on. ThoughtSpot chooses the most popular data source in the cluster that the user has access to. This allows users to begin to search data easily, without looking through all the existing data sources on their cluster.
