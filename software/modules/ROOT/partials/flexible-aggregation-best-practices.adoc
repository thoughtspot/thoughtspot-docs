== Best practices for flexible aggregations

The `group_aggregate` function enables you to calculate a result at a specific aggregation level, and then returns it at a different aggregation level.
For this reaggregation result to return correctly, follow these syntax guidelines:

* Wrap `group_aggregate` in an aggregate function, such as `sum` or `average`
* The wrapping function must be the immediate preceding function, such as `+sum(group_aggregate(...))+`
* Do not use with conditional operators.

For example, the following expression does not reaggregate the data because the `if` precedes `group_aggregate`:

(if(group_aggregate(...)))
