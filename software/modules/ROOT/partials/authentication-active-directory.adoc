Click the *Configure* button in the middle of the screen, and add your information based on the information you collected in the <<prerequisites,prerequisites>>.

If you select *yes* for *SSL required*, ThoughtSpot prompts you to enter the SSL <<ssl,certificate>> and certificate alias.
The certificate alias is a unique name you make up for your SSL certificate, in string format.
If you replace the SSL certificate, you need a new certificate alias.

After you add all your information, click *OK*.

NOTE: ThoughtSpot adds external users, or users that authenticate through SAML or Active Directory, to the *all* group by default. This group has no privileges. You must manually assign users to ThoughtSpot groups to give them privileges, such as *can upload user data*, or *can manage data*.
