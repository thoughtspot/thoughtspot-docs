=== Key Performance Indicator (KPI) chart type
endif::[]

KPI charts are now GA and on by default. You can now create visualizations of your data’s Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). When you search for a measure with a time-related keyword (for example, `Sales weekly`), you can create sparkline visualizations of your data’s Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). ThoughtSpot also supports conditional formatting to add visual cues for KPIs or threshold metrics to easily show where you are falling short or exceeding targets. This feature is dependent on the new answer experience; to use KPI charts, you must first enable the new answer experience.

[#8-4-0-sw-auto-select-search-source]
[discrete]
=== Auto-select search data source for new users

When a new user uses Search Data, ThoughtSpot intelligently selects a data source for them to search on. ThoughtSpot chooses the most popular data source in the cluster that the user has access to. This allows users to begin to search data easily, without looking through all the existing data sources on their cluster.

To create a new schedule to receive an email containing a pdf of your Liveboard, users now select the *Schedule* button to the left of the *more options menu* image:icon-more-10px.png[More options menu icon].

ThoughtSpot will migrate any existing Liveboard follows to Liveboard schedules. For users who followed a Liveboard in 7.2.1 or earlier, those Liveboard schedules appear in the list of Liveboard schedules as _Migrated from follow (your display name)_.
