NOTE: The new Information Center is not customizable. If you have the new Information Center and would like to use the customizable Help menu described in this article, contact {support-url}.

You can customize the classic Help menu for your ThoughtSpot application to tailor it to your organization. You *_cannot_* customize the new Information Center.

When you configure these Help settings, you set system-wide defaults for all your users.

When your ThoughtSpot users click the Help icon, the customizable help menu opens:

As an administrator, you can add your own links to this default list.
This allows you to include documentation specific to your company, such as information about the data available in ThoughtSpot, where to get support internally, or company-specific training.

To customize the Help menu, navigate to the Admin Console by clicking on the *Admin* tab from the top navigation bar.
Select *Help customization* from the side navigation bar that appears.

Note that you may not see the *Help customization* option, if your ThoughtSpot environment uses the new Information Center, which you cannot customize. To enable the customizable help menu, contact {support-url}.
