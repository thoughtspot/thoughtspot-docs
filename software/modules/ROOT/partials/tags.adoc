You can create tags to make it easier for people to find data sources and Liveboards. Tags are global in scope. This means that everyone can see the tags and use them to tag objects. They can also filter lists of objects by tag. Tags are often used to designate subject areas, such as sales, HR, and finance, but you can use them any way you like.

Keep in mind these permissions when working with tags:

- Only administrators can create tags.
- Anyone who has *edit* access to an object can apply a tag to it.
- Anyone can filter by a tag.
- You can only filter by one tag at a time from the UI.

[#apply-a-tag]

Only administrators create tags, but anyone with edit privileges can tag an object with a tag. The workflow for applying a tag is different depending on the type of object:

* <<answers-liveboards,Liveboards and answers>>
* <<data-workspace,Tables, worksheets, views, or SQL views>>

[#answers-liveboards]
=== Apply tags to answers or Liveboards
To tag an answer or Liveboard with a tag, follow these steps:

. From the top menu, choose *Answers* or *Liveboards*.
. Find the item(s) you want to tag in the list, and check the box next to its name.
. Click the apply tag icon and choose one from the list. You can apply as many tags as you like to an object.

[#data-workspace]

. From the top navigation bar, select *Data*.

. Select the checkbox next to the name of the object.

. Select *Edit tags* from the options at the top of the object list. Note that this option is not available if you select multiple objects.

[#filter-tags]
== Filter by tags

Whenever you are selecting objects from a list, you can filter by a tag to find what youâ€™re looking for. Anyone can use tags to filter lists of Liveboards or data sources. You can also filter by tag when selecting data sources.

Note that you can only filter by one tag at a time in the UI. To get a list of ThoughtSpot objects or object headers that is filtered by multiple tags, use the https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/?pageid=metadata-api[Metadata API^]. The `list` and `listobjectheaders` endpoints allow you to filter by multiple tags.

To filter by tag:

. From the top menu, choose **Answers**, **Liveboards**, or **Data**.
. Click on **Select tag**, and select the name of the tag you want to filter by.
