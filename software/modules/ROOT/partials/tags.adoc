You can create tags to make it easier for people to find data sources and Liveboards. Tags are global in scope. This means that everyone can see the tags and use them to tag objects. They can also filter lists of objects by tag. Tags are often used to designate subject areas, such as sales, HR, and finance, but you can use them any way you like.

Keep in mind these permissions when working with tags:

- Only administrators can create tags.
- Anyone who has *edit* access to an object can apply a tag to it.
- Anyone can filter by a tag.
- You can only filter by one tag at a time from the UI.

Note that you can only filter by one tag at a time in the UI. To get a list of ThoughtSpot objects or object headers that is filtered by multiple tags, use the https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/?pageid=metadata-api[Metadata API^]. The `list` and `listobjectheaders` endpoints allow you to filter by multiple tags.
