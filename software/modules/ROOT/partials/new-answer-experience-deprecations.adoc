The following features are *_not_* available with the new Answer experience. The new Answer experience is *_on_* by default. The option to turn it on or off individually is also on by default. If it is on in your environment, and you would like your company to be able to use these de-supported features, you can turn the new Answer experience off for your company from the xref:admin-portal-search-spotiq-settings.adoc#thoughtspot-experience[Admin Console]. Alternatively, users can turn it on or off individually from their profile.

* *Browser back button:* you can no longer use the browser back button to go back one step in a search or answer. Instead, use the new product back button to the left of an answer name.
* *Multiple join path resolution within the formula editor or a search:* when you try to search on columns with more than one possible join path, the system no longer allows you to define the join path within the search. Similarly, when you try to create a formula with columns with more than one possible join path, the system does not allow you to define the join path. Instead, the system now prompts you to resolve this issue and avoid confusion or incorrect data by creating a worksheet with the correct join path.
* *Send feedback:* The option to send product feedback, from the more options menu image:icon-more-10px.png[more options menu icon] on an answer or search.
* *Client-side summaries for tables:* We consolidated column summaries and headlines into one summary, called a headline summary. To calculate these headline summaries, ThoughtSpot executes a query against the underlying database. If you are connecting to your data in an external database, ThoughtSpot executes one query for each summary. If you store your data in ThoughtSpotâ€™s in-memory database, ThoughtSpot executes one query for all summaries in the search. These headline summaries are integrated with the table columns. You can pin them to Liveboards. After you upgrade to the new answer experience, you must manually re-enable headline summaries on charts and tables in your Liveboards from the chart or table settings. ThoughtSpot won't migrate them automatically, because of high query costs.
* *Granular access to Liveboards:* A privilege limiting some users to *Read only* access on curated Liveboards. These users could view and explore; however, they could not copy, alter, download, or share the Liveboards.
