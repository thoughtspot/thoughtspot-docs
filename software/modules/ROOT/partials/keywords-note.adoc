Use keywords to help define a search.

Note that you can only use one set of keywords at a time. If you set your locale to {locale}, you can only use {locale} keywords. You can't also use English keywords, or any other language. ThoughtSpot doesn't translate its branded terms, such as Liveboard, SpotIQ, and so on.
