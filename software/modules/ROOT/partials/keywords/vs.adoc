NOTE: ThoughtSpot supports use of multiple `contains`, `begins_with`, and `ends_with` phrases in `vs` queries. For example, you can now have a versus query such as `[state name begins_with 'a'] [state name begins_with 'c'] [vs] [state name begins_with 'd']`. For multiple `contains`, begins_with`, `ends_with` phrases on the same side of the `versus` query, ThoughtSpot will combine the phrases using `OR`.

NOTE: ThoughtSpot does not support the use of group_* formula measures with the `vs` keyword.
