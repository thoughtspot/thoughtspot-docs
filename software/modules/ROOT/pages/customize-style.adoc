To set this values, your font must be defined in a Web Open Font Format (`WOFF`) file.

If you change table fonts, older tables retain their previous fonts.
Some settings can be overridden on a per-object level.
Users cannot configure their own defaults.

== How to specify the behavior or clickable links in data

There is a system-wide setting which determines what happens when a user clicks on a link within the data.
When your data includes URLs, they display as clickable links in ThoughtSpot tables.
By default, clicking on a link opens the URL in a separate tab.
But there is a system-wide setting that can be changed to open the links within the context of where they appear.

Consider how the links open, by type:

Link in search result table in ThoughtSpot::
Same browser tab as ThoughtSpot application.
Link in table embedded in an <iframe>::
Same <iframe> that contains the table.
Link in full ThoughtSpot application embedded in an <iframe>::
Same <iframe> that contains the application.
