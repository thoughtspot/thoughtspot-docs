= Charts and tables that display a very large number of data values
:last_updated: 6/19/2020

ThoughtSpot's charts and tables can support many data values, and you can easily understand how much of the data your chart or table displays.

== High cardinality tables

ThoughtSpot tables are no longer limited to 1000 rows.
Now, you can see exactly how many rows your table displays.
Here, the table has 2318 rows:

Column summaries are not available for tables with more than 1000 rows.

== High cardinality charts

ThoughtSpot charts contain several new features.
You are no longer limited to 1000 data points.
When your chart has a very large number of data values, you see a horizontal scroll bar at the bottom.
The new default maximum number of data points is 20,000.
You can configure this maximum, up to 35,000.
To configure the maximum number of data points on a chart, xref:contact.adoc[contact ThoughtSpot Support].

If you want to see the whole chart at one time, you can select the *fit to screen* option.
To *fit to screen*, click the *edit chart configuration* image:icon-gear-10px.png[] icon, and click *settings* at the bottom of the chart configuration panel.
Select *fit to screen*.

When you *fit to screen*, you see the whole chart.
You can easily return to the zoomed-in view, by unselecting the *fit to screen* option.

You can now have more than 40 legend items in your chart.
If you attempt to xref:drag-and-drop.adoc#slice-with-color[slice with color] using a column that has more than 80 values, the recommended number of values, ThoughtSpot tells you to filter to reduce the number of values, or allows you to *render all*, if the number of values is under 250.

If you attempt to *slice with color* using a column that has more than 250 values, ThoughtSpot tells you to filter to reduce the number of values:

ThoughtSpot also warns you if your search contains too many data points, so that you can filter your search.
