= Change the join rule or RLS setting for a worksheet

As long as you have permissions to edit a worksheet, you can always go into it and set a different join or RLS rule.

If you find that the charts and tables built on a worksheet contain a large number of null values (which display as `+{blank}+` in the web browser), you can fix this by changing the xref:mod-ws-internal-joins.adoc[internal joins] for the worksheet.

If you have the *Can administer ThoughtSpot* privilege or the *Can manage data* plus edit privilege on a worksheet, you can edit the worksheet and change its RLS or other key settings.

== Change/configure a worksheet

Before working through this procedure, make sure you are familiar with how the following affect data:

* xref:mod-ws-internal-joins.adoc[internal worksheet joins]
* xref:progressive-joins.adoc[worksheet join rule]
* xref:set-rls.adoc[row level security (RLS)]

To configure these values for a worksheet:

. Click *Data* on the top navigation bar and then on *Worksheets*.
. Click the name of the worksheet you want to edit from the list.
. Click the *Edit Worksheet* button in the upper right hand side of the screen.
. Click the *+ icon* next to *Sources*.
. Scroll to the bottom of the page.
