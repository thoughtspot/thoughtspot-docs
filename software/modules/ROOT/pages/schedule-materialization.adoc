Learn how to create or change the schedule for data refresh in a materialized view.

To keep the data in a materialized view consistent and relevant, we recommend that you periodically refresh it with data from the parent table or tables.
ThoughtSpot makes it easy, by letting you schedule regular refreshes at daily, weekly, or monthly intervals.

To schedule materialization of a view, follow these steps:

include::partial$view-materialize-navigation.adoc[]

. Under *Materialization*, in the *Update schedule* section, either update an existing schedule, or create a new schedule:
 ** To update an existing schedule, click _Daily_, _Weekly_, or _Monthly_.
 ** To create a schedule, click _None_.
