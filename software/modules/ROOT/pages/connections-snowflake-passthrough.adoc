Passthrough functions allow you to send SQL expressions directly to Snowflake, without them being interpreted by ThoughtSpot. Use the passthrough functions in the ThoughtSpot Formula Assistant to call any custom database functions you implemented for your business.

A passthrough function serves as a wrapper around the specific Snowflake SQL function. You must ensure that the return data type you use with the passthrough function matches the return type of the Snowflake SQL function.

For details on all supported passthrough functions, see xref:formula-reference.adoc#passthrough-functions[Passthrough functions].
