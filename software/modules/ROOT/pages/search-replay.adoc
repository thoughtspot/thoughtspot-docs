You can instantly generate a step-by-step replay showing the creation of a table or chart.  The replay feature shows how to create the chart or table you are viewing.

Use it to teach yourself, or take a screen recording of it and create your own ThoughtSpot training for your team.

* When viewing a chart or table, click the *More* menu icon image:icon-ellipses.png[more options menu icon] and select *Replay search*.
