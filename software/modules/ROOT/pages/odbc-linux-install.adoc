Use this procedure to obtain the Linux ODBC driver and install it.

ThoughtSpot's ODBC connection relies on the https://www.simba.com/products/SEN/doc/Client-Server_user_guide/content/clientserver/configuringsimbaclientodbc/simbaclientodbcunix.htm[SimbaEngine X SDK] to connect through ODBC or JDBC to ThoughtSpot's remote data stores.
The instructions on this page explain how to configure the Simba ODBC driver on a Linux workstation.

Make sure you have read the overview material in the xref:odbc.adoc[ODBC driver overview].
This workstation is the same machine where you plan to run your ETL activities.

== Check the ThoughtSpot IP and the simba_server status

include::partial$simba-server-start.adoc[]

== Install the Simba client

On your workstation, where you want to connect from, do the following to get the ODBC driver:

. Open a browser on your workstation.
. Navigate to the xref:downloads.adoc[*Downloads*] page.
. Select *ODBC Driver for Linux* to download the driver.
. Open a terminal on your workstation.
. Change directory to the location where you downloaded the file.
. Optionally, move the file to a permanent location on your machine.
+
When you expand the downloaded file it will create a directory in the location.

. Unzip the zip file:
+
----
 gunzip ThoughtSpot_linux_odbc_<version>.tar.gz
----

. Extract the contents of the `tar` file.
+
----
 tar -xvf ThoughtSpot_linux_odbc_<version>.tar
----
+
This extracts a subdirectory called `linux` into the current directory.

. Take a moment to examine the contents of the new directory.
+
The structure contains a Simba client library, supporting libraries and  setup files for two different architectures.
It also continues error  messages for multiple languages.

The `linux/Setup` directory contains the key ODBC configuration files and  sample Simba client configurations you can use later in this procedure.

. You must know your workstation architecture to continue, confirm  your workstation's architecture.
+
You can use the `arch` or the `uname` command or both.
+
[source,bash]
----
 $ arch
   x86_64
 $ uname -a
   Linux nebula-docs-production-4vfnv 4.4.108-1.el7.elrepo.x86_64 #1 SMP Mon Dec 25 09:55:39 EST 2017 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
----
+
In previous examples, the workstation is a 64 bit workstation.
Your  workstation may be 32-bit.
You can use this architecture information in the  procedures that follow.

== (Optional) Install unixODBC tools for testing

The procedures on this page rely on the unixODBC tools to test your configuration and connection.
If you are experienced with ODBC and want to skip this, you can.
Simply substitute your preferred mechanism in the subsequent procedures where references are made to the unixODBC tools.

WARNING: Your ThoughtSpot installation contains a version of the unixODBC tools.
These tools are incompatible with CentOS.
Don't use these tools if you are performing this procedure on your ThoughtSpot server.

. Search for the unixODBC tools on your system.
+
The `yum` package manager searches for software already installed or available on your system or from the configured repositories.
Depending on your workstation configuration, you may need to use the `sudo` command with your workstation.

 $ yum search unixODBC
 ...
  * updates: repos-lax.psychz.net
 ================ N/S matched: unixODBC==============================

+
Make note of the correct package to install for your architecture.

. Install the appropriate package for your architecture.
+
In this case the command installs the tools for a 64-bit architecture.
A 32-bit package needs the  `unixODBC.i686` package.
+

 $ ls /usr/bin/isql
 /usr/bin/isql
 $ ls /usr/bin/odbcinst
 /usr/bin/odbcinst
----

== Set up your environment

In this section, you set parameters in your workstation to support your ODBC connection.

. Copy the library for your architecture from the `Lib` directory on your Linux machine.
+
|===
| Library | Architecture

| `/linux/Lib/Linux_x86`
| 32-bit

| `/linux/Lib/Linux_x8664`
| 64-bit
|===

. Add the location's path to the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable.
+
For example if your architecture is 64-bit and you keep the library in your `home` directory:
+
----
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=~/linux/Lib/Linux_x8664/
----

. Use the `echo` command to verify the path was added correctly.
+
----
echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH
----

. Copy the `odbc.ini` file to the `/etc` directory.

 $ cp ~/linux/Setup/odbc.ini  /etc
+
If you have trouble making the copy, use the `sudo` command to make the move.

. Copy the `odbcinst.ini` file to the `/etc` directory.
+
----
 $ cp ~/linux/Setup/odbcinst.ini  /etc
----

. Copy the hidden `.simba.quickstart.ini ` file to the `/etc` directory, renaming it in the process to `simbaclient.ini`.
+
----
 $ cp ~/linux/Setup/.simba.quickstart.ini  /etc/simbaclient.ini
----

. Update your environment with the `ODBCSYSINI` and `ODBCINI` variables.
+
----
 $ export ODBCSYSINI=/etc/
 $ export ODBCINI=/etc/odbc.ini
----

. Use the `/usr/bin/odbcinst` command to confirm your settings:
+
----
 $ /usr/bin/odbcinst -j
 unixODBC 2.3.1
 DRIVERS............: /etc/odbcinst.ini
 SYSTEM DATA SOURCES: /etc/odbc.ini
 FILE DATA SOURCES..: /etc/ODBCDataSources
 USER DATA SOURCES..: /etc/odbc.ini
 SQLULEN Size.......: 8
 SQLLEN Size........: 8
 SQLSETPOSIROW Size.: 8
----

== Edit the /etc/simbaclient.ini file

When you are ready, follow this procedure to configure the driver.

. Edit the `/etc/simbaclient.ini` file with your favorite editor.
2.
. Change the `ErrorMessagesPath` property to point to the location where you unzipped the client.
+
----
 [Driver]
 ErrorMessagesPath=<path_to_error_messages_directory>
----

. Comment out the `# Generic ODBCInstLib` value.
. Uncomment the `ODBCInstLib` property.
+
When you are done, your file looks like the following:
+
----
 # Generic ODBCInstLib
 #   iODBC
 #ODBCInstLib=libiodbcinst.so

 #   SimbaDM / unixODBC
 ODBCInstLib=libodbcinst.so
----

. Save and close the `/etc/simbaclient.ini` file.

== Edit the odbcinst.ini file

The `odbcinst.ini` file is a registry and configuration file for ODBC drivers.
Depending on your workstation architecture, you configure the 32-bit or 64-bit driver.

. Open the file `/etc/odbcinst.ini` in your favorite editor.
. Comment out the driver that you don't need.
+
For example, if you are using 64-bit, comment out 32-bit.

. Edit the `Driver`  line so that it contains the path to the file `libSimbaClient.so`
+
Use the path where you copied the library files.
For example, for the 64-bit ODBC driver:
+
----
 [ThoughtSpot(x64)]
 APILevel            = 1
 ConnectFunctions    = YYY
 Description         = ThoughtSpot 64bit ODBC driver
 Driver              = /home/admin/linux/Bin/Linux_x8664/libSimbaClient.so
 DriverODBCVer       = 03.52
 SQLLevel            = 1
----

. Make sure the remaining driver is named `ThoughtSpot` without any special characters.
+
When you are done, you should see something similar to the following:
+
----
 #[ThoughtSpot]
 #APILevel            = 1
 #ConnectFunctions    = YYY
 #Description         = ThoughtSpot 32bit ODBC driver
 #Driver              = /usr/local/scaligent/toolchain/local/simba/odbc/linux/Bin/Linux_x86/libSimbaClient.so
 #DriverODBCVer       = 03.80
 #SQLLevel            = 1

 [ThoughtSpot]
 APILevel            = 1
 ConnectFunctions    = YYY
 Description         = ThoughtSpot 64bit ODBC driver
 Driver              = /home/admin/linux/Bin/Linux_x8664/libSimbaClient.so
 DriverODBCVer       = 03.80
 SQLLevel            = 1
----

. Save and close the `/etc/odbcinst.ini` file.

== Edit the odbc.ini file

The `odbc.ini` file is a registry and configuration file for ODBC DSNs (Data  Source Names).
This file relies on the drivers registered in the  `/etc/odbcinst.ini` file.
Depending on your workstation architecture, you  configure the 32-bit or 64-bit driver.

. Open the file `/etc/odbc.ini` in the editor of your choice.
. Comment out the configuration that you don't need.
+
For example, if you are using 64-bit, comment out 32-bit.

. Locate the `Description` section for the type of Linux you are using (32-bit or 64-bit).
. Locate the line that begins with `ServerList`.
. Replace `127.0.0.1` with a comma separated list of the IP addresses of each node on the ThoughtSpot instance.
+
The syntax for the `ServerList` is:
+
----
 ServerList = <node1_IP> 12345, <node2_IP> 12345 [, <node3_IP> 12345, ...]
----
+
If you need to obtain the IP addresses of the ThoughtSpot cluster nodes, run  the command `tscli node ls` from a Linux shell on a ThoughtSpot appliance.

. Don't edit the port number, leave it as `12345`.
+
When you are done, your entry will look similar to the following (this  example is for the 64-bit ODBC driver):
+
----
 [ThoughtSpot]
 Description = ThoughtSpot 64-bit ODBC Driver
 Driver = ThoughtSpot
 ServerList =  172.18.231.17 12345
 Locale = en-US
 ErrorMessagesPath = /home/admin/linux/ErrorMessages
 UseSsl = 0
 #SSLCertFile = # Set the SSL certificate file path. The certificate file can be obtained by extracting the SDK tarball
 #LogLevel = 0 # Set log level to enable debug logging
 #LogPath = # Set the debug log files path
 DATABASE = # Set the default database to connect to
 SCHEMA = # Set the default schema to connect to
----

. Save and close the `odbc.ini` file.

== Test your ODBC connection

At this point, you can test your ODBC connection to ThoughtSpot.
It is important to recall that the username/password you use belongs to a ThoughtSpot application user.
Typically, this user is a user with data management or administrative privileges on the application.

. Before trying the ODBC connection, make sure you can use this username/password to login into the ThoughtSpot application.
. Confirm the user's privileges by going to the *Data* tab.
. Go back to your workstation's terminal shell.
. Use the `/usr/bin/isql` and confirm you can connect.
+
Specify the `ThoughtSpot` DSN:
+
----
 /usr/bin/isql -v ThoughtSpot tsadmin adminpwd
 +---------------------------------------+
 | Connected!                            |
 |                                       |
 | sql-statement                         |
 | help [tablename]                      |
 | quit                                  |
 |                                       |
 +---------------------------------------+
