ThoughtSpot provides several Liveboards that help with system monitoring.

There are several system monitoring Liveboards in ThoughtSpot that provide answers for system status and resource usage questions.
The information in these Liveboards are updated hourly from internal data sources that collect monitoring statistics.

Only users with the *can administer ThoughtSpot* privilege can view the monitoring Liveboards by default.
They are based on worksheets, which administrators can view, but not modify.
However, you can create new monitoring Liveboards from the worksheets.

Users with admin privileges can share the system Liveboards with other users who do not have admin privileges. However, be aware that you may be sharing sensitive user-level information such as the names of objects that a user accessed, pricing information, and so on.
