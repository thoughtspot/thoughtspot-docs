There are a few prerequisites you must complete before using ThoughtSpot Data Connect.

Before you can use ThoughtSpot Data Connect, you must enable the ThoughtSpot connection to Informatica, and enter the data connection credentials.

== Prerequisites

The following prerequisites and considerations apply to the data connect feature:

* Your Informatica account will be provisioned by ThoughtSpot.
* If you want to use HTTPS with your URL, you must provide a signed certificate when enabling ThoughtSpot Data Connect.
* You need outbound HTTPS (port 443 for infaagent) internet access to https://app.informaticaondemand.com/[https://app.informaticaondemand.com/, window=_blank] and https://app2.informaticacloud.com/[https://app2.informaticacloud.com/, window=_blank].
+
If outbound HTTPS internet access to https://app.informaticaondemand.com/[https://app.informaticaondemand.com/, window=_blank] and https://app2.informaticacloud.com/[https://app2.informaticacloud.com/, window=_blank] is not possible, you can instead add the Informatica Cloud IP address ranges `206.80.52.0/24`, `206.80.61.0/24`, `209.34.91.0/24`, and `209.34.80.0/24` to a list of allowed domains.

* You will also need any other internet connectivity and credentials required to access any cloud data sources you want to connect to, such as Salesforce.
No inbound access is required.
* After ThoughtSpot Data Connect is enabled, any user who belongs to a group with *Has administration privileges* or who *Can Manage Data* can use the feature.
Before enabling the feature, in sure that these privileges are configured properly.

Refer to the https://thoughtspot.egnyte.com/dl/fuxryvKclK[Informatica Cloud Security Architecture Overview, window=_blank] whitepaper to learn how each component and service is secured.
You can also ask ThoughtSpot Support for a copy of the document.
