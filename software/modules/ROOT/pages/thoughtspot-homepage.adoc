:jira: SCAL-151210, SCAL-175398, SCAL-250153

The home page and navigation of the ThoughtSpot app have been entirely redesigned. These features are disabled by default. To enable them, open your user profile, and in the Experience section, set the _Navigation and Homepage_ to *New experience*. If you don't see this option, it means it has been disabled for your cluster.

Your ThoughtSpot admin can enable the new navigation and home page for the cluster, in the xref:early-access-enable.adoc[Early access features] section of the Admin page.

== New home page

On the new home page, you can track KPIs in your watchlist, access favorites, your library of Answers and Liveboards, and more.

With the new left-hand navigation, you can go directly to your Liveboards, Answers, and SpotIQ Analysis. You can also access tutorials, and the ThoughtSpot documentation, and support directly from the home page.

== Persona-based navigation

The new global navigation organizes ThoughtSpot into different contextual sections called apps. Each one is designed for a common type of ThoughtSpot user. Within each app, there is left-hand navigation specific to that app. You navigate to each app using the app switcher image:app_switcher_icon.png[app switcher icon].
