Use ThoughtSpot Modeling Language to model or update tables in a flat-file format. You can migrate the object to a different cluster, or restore it to the same cluster.

To work with scriptable tables in ThoughtSpot, download these objects to a flat file in `TML` format, modify it, and subsequently upload this file either to the same cluster, or to a different cluster.
To learn how to export, change, and update tables, see xref:scriptability.adoc[Scriptability].
