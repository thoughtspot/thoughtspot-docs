Runtime filters allow you to apply filters to the data returned by the APIs or the visualization or Liveboard you're embedding.
Before you apply a runtime filter, make sure you understand their xref:runtime-filters.adoc#limitations-of-runtime-filters[limitations].

The filters are specified in the called URL as parameters.
////
(remove JS API references)
Before you can use runtime filter(s), you need to do these procedures:

. xref:js-api-enable.adoc[Enable the JavaScript API (JS API)] and authenticate to ThoughtSpot.
. Use the xref:data-api-get.adoc[Data API] or xref:embed-viz.adoc[Visualization Embedding] to retrieve the answer or Liveboard you want to use.
////
Now you are ready to add a runtime filter to your Data API call or Embedded object:

. Obtain the URL you are using to embed the visualization or call the REST API.
. Paste the URL it into a text editor.
. Append the runtime filter to the URL, using the xref:runtime-filter-operators.adoc[runtime filter operators] to get the data you want.
The format for the runtime filter depends on how you use it:
Embedding a board::
+
[source]
----
http://<thoughtspot_server>:<port>/
?col1=<column_name\>&op1=<operator\>&val1=<value\>
#/pinboard/<pinboard_id>
----

Embedding a visualization::
+
[source]
----
http://<thoughtspot_server>:<port>/
?col1=<column_name\>&op1=<operator\>&val1=<value\>
#/pinboard/<pinboard_id>/<visualization_id>
----

REST API with a board::
+
[source]
----
http://<thoughtspot_server>:<port>
/callosum/v1/tspublic/v1/pinboarddata
?id=<pinboard_id>
&col1=<column_name\>&op1=<operator\>&val1=<value\>
----

REST API with a visualization::
+
[source]
----
http://<thoughtspot_server>:<port>
/callosum/v1/tspublic/v1/pinboarddata
?id=<pinboard_id>&vizid=%5B<visualization_id>%5D
&col1=<column_name\>&op1=<operator\>&val1=<value\>
----
. To add additional filters on a particular column, you can specify multiple values by separating them with `&` (ampersand), as in the following example:
+
[source]
----
val1=foo&val1=bar
----
+
You can also use the `IN` operator for multiple values, as in this example:
+
[source]
----
col1=<column_name>&op1=IN&val1=<value>&val1=<value>
----

. Add additional filters by incrementing the number at the end of each parameter in the *Runtime Filter* for each filter you want to add, for example, `col2`, `op2`, `val2` and so on.
+
The following example passes multiple variables to a single column as well as multiple columns.
It shows that data values are returned as epoch.
+
[source]
----
col1=region&op1=IN&val1=midwest&val1=south&val1=northeast
  &col2=date&op2=BET&val2=<epoch_start>&val2=<epoch_end>
