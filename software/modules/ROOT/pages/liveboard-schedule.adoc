With scheduled Liveboard email updates, you can analyze your data offline and share Liveboards with your colleagues, including people who may not have a ThoughtSpot account.

You can schedule a Liveboard job for any Liveboard by selecting more options icon image:icon-more-10px.png[more options menu] in the upper-right corner of the Liveboard and choosing *Schedule* from the dropdown menu.

You can add multiple schedules with different configurations for a single Liveboard. However, each job is limited to one Liveboard schedule. To schedule a Liveboard for yourself, you must have at least view access for the Liveboard. To schedule a Liveboard for others, you must have the *Can schedule for others* privilege.

== Liveboard schedule email format
The format of the scheduled Liveboard email is the following. You can customize aspects of the scheduled Liveboard email, such as the email address ThoughtSpot sends it from, from the *Onboarding* section of the Admin Console. Refer to xref:admin-portal-onboarding-email-settings.adoc[].

Sender:: admin <no-reply@notification.thoughtspot.com>
Subject:: <Liveboard name> update

== Scheduling a Liveboard

To schedule a Liveboard, follow these steps:

. Navigate to the Liveboard you want to create a schedule for.
. Select the *more options* menu image:icon-more-10px.png[More options menu icon] and choose *Schedule* from the dropdown menu to create a new schedule. To modify an existing schedule, click the *more options* menu icon and select *Manage schedules*.
. In the *Create schedule* window, set the values for your schedule:
+
Name::
  Provide a short name for this schedule. This name should be descriptive and unique. This section does not appear in the Liveboard schedule email.
Description::
  Enter a description to remind yourself and to inform others. If this is an important schedule for a meeting or a report, you should mention that. This section appears as *Description: <your content>* in the Liveboard schedule email.
Frequency::
You can rebuild a Liveboard every _n_ minutes, hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly. For some of these, you can also choose specific times of the day or days of the week.
+
If you schedule a Liveboard hourly or every _n_ minutes, ThoughtSpot bases the schedule on when you first schedule the Liveboard. For example, if you schedule a Liveboard to repeat every 3 hours, and you first click on *Schedule* at 8:14 A.M., ThoughtSpot sends it to you at 11:14 A.M., 2:14 P.M., and so on.
+
Make sure to note the *Server time zone*.
Type::
  * *PDF files* show all visualizations in the Liveboard. Each chart uses a page in the file; tables show only the first 100 rows of a table. Use PDF files to skim the data. The Liveboard schedule email contains 1 PDF with the entire Liveboard.
  ** *Show advanced PDF settings* allows you to specify the Liveboard layout in PDF format, and which visualizations and tabs to include. For more details about the layout options, refer to xref:liveboard-download-pdf.adoc[Download a Liveboard as a PDF].

  * *CSV files* provide all data for tables, with one attachment for each table. If your Liveboard has 3 tables and 4 charts, the Liveboard schedule email contains 3 CSVs, one for each table, and no content on the charts in the Liveboard. Use CSV files to perform further analysis offline.
  ** Refer to xref:schedule-liveboards.adoc#format[Format of scheduled Liveboards] for more information about the differences between CSV and PDF attachments in a scheduled Liveboard email.

  * *XLSX files* provide all data for tables, with an Excel attachment for each table. If your Liveboard has 3 tables and 4 charts, the Liveboard schedule email contains 3 XLSX files, one for each table, and no content on the charts in the Liveboard. Use XLSX files to share information and perform further analysis offline in Excel.
  ** Refer to xref:schedule-liveboards.adoc#format[Format of scheduled Liveboards] for more information about the differences between CSV and PDF attachments in a scheduled Liveboard email.

+
NOTE: Liveboard schedule pdf/csv/xlsx files sent via email are stored in the cluster until either, the cluster is restarted, or another scheduled run for a Liveboard occurs. All pdfs older than 24 hrs for that Liveboard are cleared.



Gating condition::
Write a statement that returns a single boolean value (`true` or `false`). For example, `sum (revenue) > 100` is a valid condition, but `is_weekend (commit_date)` is not, since it returns a result per row of data. Use any data source (table, worksheet, or view) that you have access to for the gating condition. However, note that for reports sent to ThoughtSpot users, ThoughtSpot executes the query as that specific user so that it respects row-level security (RLS) and ensures data security. If you schedule the Liveboard for 3 users, and 1 user does not have access to the data source in the gating condition, the gating condition fails and ThoughtSpot does not send the Liveboard to that 1 user. It does send the Liveboard to the 2 users who do have data access. For reports sent to people who are not ThoughtSpot users, ThoughtSpot executes the query as the author of the Liveboard schedule. The gating condition will still work if you are using passthrough security for your external data warehouse connection. The gating condition formula and any tables you use in it do not need to be related to the Liveboard the gating condition is for. You can use any valid formula in your statement. ThoughtSpot checks the formula syntax, but does not validate if the formula returns a valid single boolean.
+
At the scheduled time, ThoughtSpot executes the gating condition query. If the condition evaluates to `true`, ThoughtSpot processes the Liveboard.
+
For a list of valid formulas, see xref:formula-reference.adoc[Formula function reference].
+
For an in-depth example of a scenario where a gating condition is useful and powerful, refer to xref:liveboard-gating-condition-example.adoc[].

Recipients::
  You are limited to 1000 recipients for each job. You can add *Users* or *groups*. Use *Emails* to add recipients who are not ThoughtSpot users. Your ThoughtSpot admin must set these email domains as allowed domains in advance. Contact {support-url} to add allowed domains.
+
If you experience problems with sending email, your cluster may not have SMTP enabled. Contact your system administrator to resolve this issue.
+
NOTE: You must have the *Can schedule for others* privilege to add other recipients to your Liveboard schedule.

Views::
You can select a view to be scheduled instead of the standard Liveboard. When selected, the filters and parameters are updated to reflect the values set in the view.

[#pdf-width]
== Change PDF width

By default, Liveboard PDFs download at a width of 1920 pixels, which supports most Liveboard visualizations and layouts. To change this default width to a different width in pixels for your company, contact {support-url}. For example, if most users in your company view ThoughtSpot in full screen, request that ThoughtSpot set the Liveboard PDF width to the full screen width.
