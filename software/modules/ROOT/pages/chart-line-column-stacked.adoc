:description: The line stacked column chart is similar to the line column chart, except that it divides its columns with an attribute in the legend.

This chart is similar to the line column chart, except that it divides its columns with an attribute in the legend. The line stacked column chart combines xref:chart-column-stacked.adoc[stacked column] and xref:chart-line.adoc[line] charts.
There are two y-axes, one for each measure.

You can choose to enable shared y-axis by clicking the dropdown menu icon image:icon-caret-right-20px.png[] next to the Y-axis label and selecting *Group* for both measures.
