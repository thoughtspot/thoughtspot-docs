This chart is similar to the line column chart, except that it divides its columns with an attribute in the legend. The line stacked column chart combines xref:chart-column-stacked.adoc[stacked column] and xref:chart-line.adoc[line] charts.
There are two y-axes, one for each measure.

You can choose to enable shared y-axis by clicking the dropdown menu icon image:icon-caret-right-20px.png[] next to the Y-axis label and selecting *Group* for both measures.
