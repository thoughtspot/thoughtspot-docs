Learn about searching within a Liveboard.

You can perform many of the same search actions on individual visualizations within a Liveboard as you can within a search.
You can interact directly with a visualization of a Liveboard to perform ad hoc searches or edit it.

To directly edit a visualization, follow these steps:

. Select the *More* menu icon image:icon-more-10px.png[more options menu icon] in the upper-right corner of your visualization.

. Select *Edit*.

. You are now in edit mode for the visualization, where you can xref:search-choose-data-source.adoc[view and change sources], xref:search-bar.adoc[search different columns], xref:chart-table-change.adoc[change the view], xref:views.adoc[save the answer as a worksheet], xref:formulas.adoc[add a formula], and xref:chart-change.adoc[change the chart].
