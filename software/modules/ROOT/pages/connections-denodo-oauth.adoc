:description: Learn how to configure OAuth for a Denodo connection in ThoughtSpot.

ThoughtSpot supports OAuth for a {connection} connection.

To configure OAuth for {connection}, you create an app in the Identity Provider and use the appâ€™s credentials to register it in {connection} as an external token provider. Once these steps are completed, {connection} will allow connections coming in with the JWT issued by the IdP.

[#part-1]
== Part 1: Configuring the IdP with Okta

The following steps detail the configuration of IdP with Okta as an example. You can set up any other OpenID Connect (OIDC)-based IdP providers following a similar process. For details, refer to the respective documentation for those.

To configure the IdP with Okta, do the following:

. Sign in to the Okta console with a user having administrator privileges. Navigate to the *Applications* page in the console and select *Create App Integration*.

+
. For sign-in method, choose *OIDC - OpenID Connect*.
. For application type, choose *Web Application*
. Select *Next*.
. Under Grant type, make sure *Authorization Code* and *Refresh Token* are selected.
+

. For Sign-in redirect URIs, add the ThoughtSpot redirect URI for the application.
+
It should follow this format:
+
`\https://<your-thoughtspot-instance-host>/callosum/v1/connection/generateTokens`
+

. Assign the application to everyone in the organization or to specific groups. This step may vary for other IdPs.

. Collect the client credentials from the application home page and make a note of them. These will be required later for adding the external token provider in {connection}.

. Go to menu:Security[API], and make a note of the value for Audience. This is required in a later step
for configuring the OpenID well-known URI for the authorization server.

+
For Okta, it should follow this format:
+
`\https://<organization>.okta..com/oauth2/<unique_id>/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`
. Open the URL in a browser and make a note of the values for the following parameters:
- Issuer
- Authorization endpoint
- JWKS URI
- Token endpoint

== Part 2: Adding external token provider in {connection}

To add an external token provider in {connection}, do the following:

. Sign in to the {connection} administrator tool and select the *Administration* tab.
. Select *Server Authentication* from the menu.
. Select *OAuth* and fill in the details from your IdP.
+

+
For User Claim Mapping, use the value of the claim in the JWT issued by the IdP that contains the value of the username in {connection}.
+
Example token generated by Okta:

== Part 3: JDBC Connection URL

Connection string for JDBC should include the token string for password parameter with username left empty.

Example connection string:

----
jdbc:vdb://<host>:<port>/<database>?publishCatalogsAsSchemas=true&useOAuth2=true
