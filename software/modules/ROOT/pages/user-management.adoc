:description: Manually create, edit, or delete a user from the Admin console in ThoughtSpot.

For each unique person who accesses ThoughtSpot, you must create a user account. When you create a user manually in ThoughtSpot, you continue to manage that user in ThoughtSpot.

You can create users directly in ThoughtSpot, or import users and user groups through LDAP or similar protocols.

For users who have access through LDAP, the LDAP installation manages all user information.

[#add-user]
== Create a user in ThoughtSpot

This procedure demonstrates how to create a user manually.
When you create a user, you can specify the _<<username,username>>_, _<<display-name,display name>>_, _<<sharing-visibility,sharing visibility>>_, the _<<password,password>>_, _<<email,email>>_, whether they get a _<<email-welcome,welcome email>>_ and its _<<email-text,text>>_, and assign _<<groups,group>>_ memberships.
The user inherits privileges and permissions directly from the group assignments.

Note that all users automatically belong to the group *All*.

To create a new user and assign that user to groups, follow these steps:

. Sign in to ThoughtSpot from a browser.
. Navigate to the Admin Console by selecting the *Admin* tab from the top navigation bar.
. Select *Users* from the side navigation bar that appears.

. Select the *+ Add User* button on the upper-left side of the list of users.
. In the *Add a new user* interface, enter the details for the new user:
+
image::add-user.png[Add a new User]
+
[#username]
Username::
  A login name for the user. Usernames must be unique and lowercase. If you are using Active Directory to authenticate users, and your LDAP configuration requires users to be created manually (they aren't created automatically in ThoughtSpot upon authentication), the username you specify has to be domain-qualified (`username@ldap.thoughtspot.com`), and you must enter a dummy password.
[#display-name]
Display name::
  A unique name for the user (usually their first and last name).
[#sharing-visibility]
Sharing visibility::
  Indicate whether objects can be shared with this user. When set to *SHAREABLE*, this user is an option in the *Share* dialog.
[#password]
Change password::
  Add or change the password. Your password must meet the following requirements:
* The password must be 8 characters or more in length.
* The password must include at least 1 uppercase letter, 1 lowercase letter, 1 number, and 1 special character.
* The password must pass a complexity test based on an external library. This test ensures password complexity and uniqueness by checking for known patterns or words that are too simple. If the password isn't complex enough, ThoughtSpot rejects it, even if it fulfills the other requirements. Refer to the https://github.com/dropbox/zxcvbn[Dropbox password library^] for more information.
* The password can't use certain blocked words. By default, the blocked words are: your username, any part of your display name, and any blocked words your company configures. To add additional words to the blocklist, contact {support-url}.
Confirm password::
  Enter the password again.
[#email]
Email::
  The user's email address. ThoughtSpot uses this for notification when another user shares something with them, for onboarding, and others.
+
NOTE: During cluster configuration, the administrator specifies the email server domain. ThoughtSpot doesn't accept emails outside this domain. Contact {support-url} to add new domains to a list of allowed domains.
[#email-welcome]
Send a welcome email::
  (Optional) When checked, this option ensures that the new user receives a welcome email. You can customize other aspects of the onboarding email, such as the email address ThoughtSpot sends it from, from the *Onboarding* section of the Admin Console. Refer to xref:admin-portal-onboarding-email-settings.adoc[].
[#email-text]
Email message text::
  (Optional) Enter text of the optional welcome email here.
[#groups]
Groups::
  (Recommended) Select the groups for the user.
+
[NOTE]
====
When you create a new user, the groups they belong to define the following attributes for the user:

Privileges:: the actions they can perform, defined when you xref:group-management.adoc[add a group and set security privileges]

Permissions:: the data they can access and view, defined when you consider xref:data-security.adoc[data security]

Administrators can see all data sources, and xref:security-rls.adoc[row-level security] doesn't apply to them.
====
+
WARNING: If you add the user to a group that has the privilege *Has administration privileges*, they can see all the data in ThoughtSpot.

. Select *Add* to create the user.

Note that this process of identifying the user's needs contributes to a robust onboarding process.
See xref:onboarding.adoc[Onboarding users].

[#edit-user]
