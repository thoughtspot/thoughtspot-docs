:description: If you would like to use a different data source, select the *Choose Sources* button to browse other data sources.

When you first use Search, ThoughtSpot intelligently selects a data source for you to search on. ThoughtSpot chooses the most popular data source in the cluster that you have access to. You can choose a different data source.

NOTE: As part of the new Data Fluency features in 9.5.0.sw, you can use a new and improved way to choose a data source. See Choosing a data source with Data Fluency for details.

== Choosing a data source

Select the *Choose Sources* button to browse other data sources.

You will see a list of data sources that have been shared with you.
The data sources are usually created by your administrator, though you can also xref:load-csv.adoc[upload your own data].

NOTE: You can't select more than 100 data sources at a time. This maximum of 100 data sources improves performance and limits timeouts due to too many sources.

Searches happen in the context of the selected data sources.
ThoughtSpot will also make suggestions from other data sources for you, if what you're typing can't be found in the selected data source.

== Choosing a data source with the new data panel experience

With the new Data Fluency feature, you can use the new Answer data panel experience.
