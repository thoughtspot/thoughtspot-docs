+
Refer to the xref:connections-presto-reference.adoc[{connection} connection reference] for more information on each of the specific attributes you must enter for your connection.
. (Optional) Configure proxy for your {connection} connection by doing the following:
.. Click the *Advanced Config* menu to reveal the Key and Value fields.
.. For Key, enter *httpProxy*, and for Value, enter *<proxyHost>:<proxyPort>*.
+
Example: *40.142.32.22:5050*
. (Optional) Provide additional key-value pairs that you need to set up your connection to {connection} or customize additional JDBC parameters supported by {connection}, by doing the following:
 .. Click the *Advanced Config* menu to reveal the *Key* and *Value* fields.
 .. Enter your key and value information.
 .. To add more keys and values, click the plus sign (+), and enter them.

+
NOTE: Any key-value pairs that you enter must be defined in your {connection} data source.
Key-value pairs are case-sensitive.
. Click *Continue*.
. Select tables (on the left) and the columns from each table (on the right), and then click *Create connection*.

// ![Select tables and columns for your connection]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/Trino-selecttables.png "Select tables and columns for your connection")
+
A message appears indicating the number of tables and columns that will be added to your connection.

. Click *Confirm*.
+
Once the connection is added, you can search your {connection} database right away by clicking *Search now*.

+
Your new connection appears on the *Data* > *Connections* page.
You can click the name of your connection to view the tables and columns in your connection.

The connection you just created is a link to the external data source.
If there are any joins in the selected tables of the external data source, those are imported into ThoughtSpot.

You can now perform a live query on the selected tables and columns of your connection.
Because the selected tables and columns in your connection are linked, it may take a while to initially render the search results.
This is because ThoughtSpot does not cache linked data.
With linked data, ThoughtSpot queries the external database directly, which is slower than querying data that is stored in ThoughtSpot's database.

You can modify a {connection} connection in the following ways:

* xref:connections-presto-edit.adoc[Edit a {connection} connection]
* xref:connections-presto-remap.adoc[Remap a {connection} connection]
* xref:connections-presto-delete-table.adoc[Delete a table from a {connection} connection]
* xref:connections-presto-delete-table-dependencies.adoc[Delete a table with dependent objects]

You can also xref:connections-presto-delete.adoc[Delete a {connection} connection].

See the xref:connections-presto-reference.adoc[Connection reference] for details of connection parameters.
