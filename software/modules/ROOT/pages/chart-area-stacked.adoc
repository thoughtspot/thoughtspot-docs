The stacked area chart is an xref:chart-area.adoc[area chart] with an attribute in the legend, which divides the area into layers.

Stacked area charts show the relative contribution to the accumulated total of a measure over time.

Stacked area charts plot the y-axis as a percentage by default.
You can also view your chart with the Y-axis set to 100%.
Click on the *Chart configuration* icon image:icon-gear-10px.png[chart configuration icon] and select the Y-axis measure.
Under *Number format*, toggle *Stack 100%* on or off.
You can also click on the attribute you are using to *slice with color* to find the *Stack 100%* option.
