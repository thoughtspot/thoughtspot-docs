Learn how to allow people in your organization to sign up for ThoughtSpot.

You can allow people in your organization to sign up for ThoughtSpot by clicking a button on the sign-in page.

You do this by providing them with the ThoughtSpot sign-up URL.
When they go to this URL, they see the sign-up button.

When a person clicks the sign-up button, they go to a sign-up page that you've already set up outside of ThoughtSpot.
This can be any external page you want to use for registering new users, such as Service Now or SharePoint.

== Create the ThoughtSpot sign-up URL

Follow this syntax for creating the URL:
[source]
----
https://<your-thoughtspot-URL>/?signUpEnabled=true&signUpButtonLink=https://<your-sign-up-page-URL>
----
Example: `+https://thoughtspot.mycompany.com/?signUpEnabled=true&signUpButtonLink=https://signup.mycompany.com/thoughtspot+`

== Customize the sign-up button text

By default, the button text is '`Sign up`', but you have the option to change it.
To do that, you add the '`signUpButtonText`' parameter to the URL and include the custom text you want.
If the text contains spaces, you must replace each space with a percent sign and the number 20 (%20).
For example, if you wanted the button text to be '`Request Account`', you would use '`Request%20Account`'.

Follow this syntax for creating the URL with custom button text:
[source]
----
https://<your-thoughtspot-URL>/?signUpEnabled=true&signUpButtonText=<your-sign-up-button-text>&signUpButtonLink=https://<your-sign-up-page-URL>
----
Example: `+https://thoughtspot.mycompany.com/?signUpEnabled=true&signUpButtonText=Request%20Account&signUpButtonLink=https://signup.mycompany.com/thoughtspot+`

== Display the sign-up button by default

If you want to display the sign-up button on the ThoughtSpot sign-in page without using the special sign-up URL, xref:support-contact.adoc[contact ThoughtSpot Support].
