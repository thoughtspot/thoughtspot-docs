= Add a node to a ThoughtSpot cluster on RHEL
:last_updated: 6/10/2020

You can easily configure an additional node for a ThoughtSpot cluster on RHEL.

To add a new node to a ThoughtSpot cluster deployed through RHEL, you must first make this new node ready for ThoughtSpot.

[#prerequisites]
== Prerequisites

* The new node must be available.
* The new node must be of the same deployment type as the existing cluster.
* Your organization's RHEL base image must be on the new node.

[#configure-ansible]
== Configure the Ansible Playbook

Follow the general steps for configuring the Ansible Playbook, either on xref:rhel-install-online.adoc#configure-ansible[online clusters], or on xref:rhel-install-offline.adoc#configure-ansible[offline clusters].

. Save a new copy of the `hosts.yaml` file, as `new-host.yaml`.
. In the `hosts` parameter, *_only_* specify the `IP` or `hostname` of the new node.
. Do not change the rest of the file;
the Ansible configuration must be identical to the existing cluster.

[#run-ansible]
== Run the Ansible Playbook

Run the Ansible Playbook from your local machine by entering the following command:
[source]
----
ansible-playbook -i new-host.yaml ts.yaml
----

As the Ansible Playbook runs, it will perform the same tasks on the new node that it completed during the initial cluster set-up, but only for the new node.
See xref:rhel-install-online.adoc#run-ansible[Run Ansible].
It will install all xref:rhel-packages.adoc[Yum, Python, and R packages], configure the local user accounts for ThoughtSpot administration, install the ThoughtSpot CLI, and configure the node (create any necessary partitions, formatting the data disks, and running the `prepare disks` command).

After the Ansible Playbook finishes, your new host is ready for installing the ThoughtSpot application.

[#install-thoughtspot]
== Install the ThoughtSpot application on the new node

Follow these general steps to install ThoughtSpot on the new node:

. Download the release artifact from the ThoughtSpot file sharing system, or get it from your organization's .
. Upload the release artifact to the node.
. Run the `tscli cluster create` command.
This script prompts you for user input.
. Check the cluster health by running health checks and logging into the application.
Refer to the ThoughtSpot documentation for the detailed steps to install ThoughtSpot for each deployment platform:

* xref:inthebox.adoc[Hardware appliance]
* xref:configuration-options.adoc[Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2]
* xref:configuration-options.adoc[Microsoft Azure]
* xref:configuration-options.adoc[Google Cloud Platform (GCP)]
* xref:vmware-intro.adoc[VMware]

Follow these general steps to install ThoughtSpot on the prepared hosts:

. Download the release artifact from the ThoughtSpot file sharing system.
. Upload the release artifact to the first host.
. Run the `tscli cluster create` command.
This script prompts you for user input.
. Check the cluster health by running health checks and logging into the application.
