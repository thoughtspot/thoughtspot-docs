:description: You can easily configure an additional node for a ThoughtSpot cluster running on AL2, OEL, or RHEL.

You can easily configure an additional node for a ThoughtSpot cluster on AL2, OEL, or RHEL.

To add a new node to a ThoughtSpot cluster deployed through your own OS, you must first make this new node ready for ThoughtSpot.

NOTE: If your cluster is on RHEL, and your organization requires that privilege escalation take place through an external tool that integrates with ansible, follow the steps in xref:rhel-add-node-ansible.adoc[]. For more information, see xref:rhel-ansible.adoc[].

[#prerequisites]
== Prerequisites

* The new node must be available.
* The new node must be of the same deployment type as the existing cluster.
* Your organization's AL2, OEL, or RHEL base image must be on the new node.

[#configure-ansible]
== Configure the ansible Playbook

Follow the general steps for configuring the ansible Playbook on xref:customer-os-ansible-configure.adoc#configure[Configure and run the ansible playbook].

. Save a new copy of the `hosts.yaml` file, as `new-host.yaml`.
. In the `hosts` parameter, *_only_* specify the `IP` or `hostname` of the new node.
. Do not change the rest of the file; the ansible configuration must be identical to the existing cluster.

[#run-ansible]
== Run the ansible Playbook

Run the ansible Playbook from your local machine by entering the following command:
[source]
----
ansible-playbook -i new-host.yaml ts.yaml
----

As the ansible Playbook runs, it will perform the same tasks on the new node that it completed during the initial cluster set-up, but only for the new node.
See xref:customer-os-ansible-configure.adoc#run[Run ansible].
It will install all xref:customer-os-packages.adoc[Yum, Python, and R packages], configure the local user accounts for ThoughtSpot administration, install the ThoughtSpot CLI, and configure the node (create any necessary partitions, formatting the data disks, and running the `prepare disks` command).

After the ansible Playbook finishes, your new host is ready for installing the ThoughtSpot application.

[#install-thoughtspot]
== Install the ThoughtSpot application on the new node

Follow these general steps to install ThoughtSpot on the new node:

. Download the release artifact from the ThoughtSpot file sharing system, or get it from your organization's.
. Upload the release artifact to the node.
. Run the `tscli cluster create` command. This script prompts you for user input.
. Check the cluster health by running health checks and logging in to the application. Refer to the ThoughtSpot documentation for the detailed steps to install ThoughtSpot for each deployment platform:

* [*_RHEL, OEL, and AL2_*] xref:aws-configuration-options.adoc[Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2]

* [*_RHEL and OEL only_*] xref:gcp-configuration-options.adoc[Google Cloud Platform (GCP)]
