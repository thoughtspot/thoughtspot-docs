:description: To successfully deploy ThoughtSpot, you must have the following packages on each node of your ThoughtSpot cluster: yum, python 3, and R.

To successfully deploy ThoughtSpot in your organization, you must have the following packages on each node of your ThoughtSpot cluster: <<yum,yum>>, <<pip,python 3>>, and <<r,R>>. ThoughtSpot does not install the R packages if you define the xref:customer-os-ansible-configure.adoc#skip_r[skip_r] flag in the ansible playbook.
When the ansible playbook runs, it automatically installs the packages.

ThoughtSpot also uses the third-party software packages listed in xref:third-party.adoc[].

NOTE: If your organization requires that privilege escalation take place through an external tool that integrates with ansible, you must install the packages yourself. The ansible playbook does not install them. Refer to xref:rhel-install-ansible.adoc[].
