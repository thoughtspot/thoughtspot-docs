Consider these guidelines to ensure HA of ThoughtSpot app, and node resilience.

== Requirements for node resilience

* The cluster must have at least 3 nodes.
* The cluster must have spare capacity;
if one node fails, the remaining nodes must be able to host and serve all loaded data.

== What happens during node failure

* When a node loses connection with the main service manager process, it becomes *unhealthy*.
* ThoughtSpot migrates all migratable services that run on the failed node to other (*healthy*) nodes.
For all practical purposes, ThoughtSpot ignores the failed node until it reports itself as *healthy*.
* ThoughtSpot rebalances and redistributes the data served from the failed node onto healthy nodes.
Healthy nodes read the data from the the HDFS storage layer into the in-memory database processes.

== Disruption: impact on users

The process of redistributing and loading the data in the affected tables on HDFS layer from a failed node to the remaining healthy nodes is not instantaneous.
The failover may impact the user experience.
