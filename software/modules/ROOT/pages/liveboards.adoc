Create a new Liveboard to group and manage related search results.

Liveboards act like live dashboards.
They are collections of your related charts, tables, and headlines.

You can pin charts and tables to any Liveboard that you created, and the Liveboards that have been shared with you with the *Edit* privilege.
When you create a Liveboard, you can share it with other people with either the *View* or *Edit* privilege.
Liveboards are interactive, allowing you to perform actions like filtering, excluding values, and drill down on the visualizations.

For more details, see xref:liveboard-download-pdf.adoc[Download a Liveboard as PDF].

[#export-tml]

You can download a Liveboard as a xref:tml.adoc[TML], or ThoughtSpot Modeling Language, file, optionally modify it, and migrate it to another cluster, or re-upload it to the same cluster.

Refer to xref:scriptability.adoc[Migrate or restore objects].

[#details]
== Details about a Liveboard

You can see who authored a Liveboard, when it was created, and when it was last modified by selecting the *More* menu icon image:icon-more-10px.png[more options menu icon] and selecting *Show Liveboard details*.

[#liveboard-usage]
== View Liveboard usage

You can see who viewed or interacted with a Liveboard within the last 120 days. To the top right of the Liveboard, next to the share and schedule icon, click on the list of names and user icons. A modal appears, listing the user that created the Liveboard, and the users who recently viewed or interacted with it.

[#edit-mode]
== Edit a Liveboard
If you are using the xref:liveboard-experience-new.adoc[new Liveboard experience], you must enter *Edit mode* to make any changes to the Liveboard. To enter edit mode, select the more options menu image:icon-more-10px.png[more options menu icon] for the Liveboard, and select *Edit*.

[#back-button]
== Undo, redo, and reset buttons
As you work with Liveboard visualizations, you may want to undo or redo an action. Use the in-product undo, redo, and reset buttons to reset or go back or forward 1 step each time you make a change in a search, saved answer, or Liveboard visualization (for example, when you drill down, or sort). These buttons appear to the left of the *Explore* button in a Liveboard visualization. Note that the reset button is only available for saved answers and visualizations; it resets the answer to its last saved state.

You can see these options when you select the *More* menu icon image:icon-more-10px.png[more options menu icon] in the top right corner of the Liveboard. Note that there are different options in the more menu for the Liveboard, depending on whether you are in *view* or <<edit-mode,edit>> mode.
