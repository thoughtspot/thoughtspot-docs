Create a new Liveboard to group and manage related search results.

Liveboards act like live dashboards.
They are collections of your related charts, tables, and headlines.

You can pin charts and tables to any Liveboard that you created, and the Liveboards that have been shared with you with the *Edit* privilege.
When you create a Liveboard, you can share it with other people with either the *View* or *Edit* privilege.
Liveboards are interactive, allowing you to perform actions like filtering, excluding values, and drill down on the visualizations.

To add an answer to a Liveboard:

For more details, see xref:liveboard-download-pdf.adoc[Download a Liveboard as PDF].

[#edit-mode]
== Edit a Liveboard

This includes adding filters, adding tabs, and changing the layout. You do not need to enter edit mode to change the name of the Liveboard or Liveboard visualizations.

To enter edit mode, select the *Edit* button at the upper right of the Liveboard. If this button is grayed out, you do not have edit privileges for the Liveboard. To resolve this, contact your administrator or the creator of the Liveboard.

A modal appears, listing the user that created the Liveboard, and the users who recently viewed or interacted with it.

[#undo-redo]
== Undo, redo, and reset buttons

As you work with Liveboard visualizations, you may want to undo or redo an action. Use the in-product undo, redo, and reset buttons to reset or go back or forward 1 step each time you make a change in a search, saved answer, or Liveboard visualization (for example, when you drill down, or sort). These buttons appear to the left of the *Explore* button in a Liveboard visualization. Note that the reset button is only available for saved answers and visualizations; it resets the answer to its last saved state.
