Liveboards act like live dashboards.
They are collections of your related charts, tables, and headlines.

You can pin charts and tables to any Liveboard that you created, and the Liveboards that have been shared with you with the *Edit* privilege.
When you create a Liveboard, you can share it with other people with either the *View* or *Edit* privilege.
Liveboards are interactive, allowing you to perform actions like filtering, excluding values, and drill down on the visualizations.
