ThoughtSpot has intuitive and powerful user group management for assigning privileges, user selection, multi-tier subgroups, default Pinboard assignment, and emailing.

Before adding users, create the groups to which they belong.
Each group includes a set of privileges for its users.

[#add-group]
== Create a group

To create a group and add privileges for the group, follow these steps:

. Log in to ThoughtSpot from a browser.
. Navigate to the Admin Console by clicking on the *Admin* tab from the top navigation bar.
. Select *Groups* from the side navigation bar that appears.
+

. Click the *+ Add Group* button on the upper left-hand side of the list of groups.
. In the *Add a new group* modal, enter the details for the new group:
+
image::add-group.png[Enter details for the new group]
+
[#group-name]
Group name::
  Enter a unique name for the group.
+
[#display-name]
Display name::
  Name of the group as it appears in ThoughtSpot.
+
[#sharing-visibility]
Sharing visibility::
  Indicate whether objects can be shared with this group. When set to *SHARABLE*,
    this group is an option in the *Share* dialog.
+
[#description]
Description::
  Optionally, enter a description.
+
[#privileges]
Privileges::
    Check the xref:groups-privileges.adoc#list-of-privileges[privileges] you want to grant to the group. If you add the privilege *Has administration privileges* to a group, all users in that group can see all the data in ThoughtSpot. Administrators can always see all data sources, and xref:security-rls.adoc[Row level security] does not apply to them.

. You can also add _<<add-groups,Groups>>_ (these would be the subgroups of the group you are editing), _<<add-users,Users>>_.
Also, see _<<add-default-pinboards,Default Pinboards>>_.
. Click *Add* to create the group.

[#add-default-pinboards]
=== Default Pinboards

You cannot add default Pinboards to a new user group.
You must create it first, and then edit it to add default Pinboards.
See *<<change-default-pinboards,Edit a group > Default Pinboards>>*.
