Displaying your Liveboard as a slideshow is a good way to present its contents to others.

With ThoughtSpot's interactive presentations, you can easily explore and answer questions from the audience during the presentation session.
When you present your Liveboard, ThoughtSpot displays the component visualizations and tables in order from left to right, and top to bottom.

== Starting a presentation

To start a presentation, follow these steps:

. Select *Liveboards* on the top navigation bar.
. Select a Liveboard from the list of Liveboards by clicking on its title.
. In the open Liveboard, select the *more options* menu image:icon-more-10px.png[more options menu icon] (ellipses icon).

. Select *Present*.

. ThoughtSpot displays the Liveboard in full screen. If the Liveboard has multiple tabs, the presentation includes a title slide for each tab before presenting visualizations in the tab.
+
To navigate through the slides of the presentation, use the left and right arrow navigation keys on your keyboard, or the up and down arrow buttons in the upper-right corner of the presentation.

The presentation navigation controls enable you to effectively run the presentation.

Hover over the upper-right corner of the presentation to see the navigation control options:

. Select the slide number to expand the list of visualizations, and navigate directly to a different slide.

. Select the left arrow to go to the previous slide.

. Select the right arrow to go to the next slide.

. Select the *x* to end the presentation.
