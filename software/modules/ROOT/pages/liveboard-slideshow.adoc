Displaying your Liveboard as a slideshow is a good way to present its contents to others.

With ThoughtSpot's interactive presentations, you can easily explore and answer questions from the audience during the presentation session.
When you present your Liveboard, ThoughtSpot displays the component visualizations and tables in order from left to right, and top to bottom.

To start a presentation, follow these steps:

. Click *Liveboards* on the top navigation bar.
. Select a Liveboard from the list of Liveboards by clicking on its title.
. In the open Liveboard, click the *more options* menu image:icon-more-10px.png[more options menu icon] (ellipses icon).

. Select *image:icon-present.png[present icon] Present*.

. ThoughtSpot displays the Liveboard in full screen.

To navigate through the slides of the presentation, use the left and right arrow navigation keys on your keyboard, or the up and down arrow buttons in the upper right corner of the presentation.
