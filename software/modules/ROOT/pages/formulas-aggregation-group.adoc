Learn about group aggregation functions, or pinned measures.

What if you want to aggregate a value by a specific attribute (for example, show revenue by product)?
This is known as a grouped aggregation, but some people call it a pinned measure or level-based measure.
You can do this for any aggregation using the grouping functions.

Each of the grouping functions accepts a measure and one or more optional attributes:

[source]
----
formula (measure, [attribute, attribute, ...])
----

Only the measure value is required.
If you supply both a measure and an attribute, the function returns the aggregate of the measure grouped by the attribute(s).
You should experiment with only a measure and then with an attribute to see which output best meets your use case.

NOTE: xref:chart-pivot-table.adoc[Pivot tables] do not support use of group aggregation functions.

== List of group functions

Group aggregation functions have names with formats like `group_<aggregation>`.
The group aggregation functions are the following:

`group_average`::
  Takes a measure and one or more attributes. Returns the average of the measure grouped by the attribute(s).
+
`group_average (revenue, customer region)`

`group_count`::
  Takes a measure and one or more attributes. Returns the count of the measure grouped by the attribute(s).
+
`group_count (revenue, customer region)`

`group_max`::
  Takes a measure and one or more attributes. Returns the maximum of the measure grouped by the attribute(s).
+
`group_max (revenue, customer region)`

`group_min`::
  Takes a measure and one or more attributes. Returns the minimum of the measure grouped by the attribute(s).
+
`group_min (revenue, customer region)`

`group_stddev`::
  Takes a measure and one or more attributes. Returns the standard deviation of the measure grouped by the attribute(s).
+
`group_stddev (revenue, customer region)`

`group_sum`::
  Takes a measure and one or more attributes. Returns the sum of the measure grouped by the attribute(s).
+
`group_sum (revenue, customer region)`

`group_unique_count`::
  Takes a column name and one or more attributes. Returns the number of unique values in a column, grouped by the attribute(s).
+
`group_unique_count ( product, supplier)`

`group_variance`::
  Takes a measure and one or more attributes. Returns the variance of the measure grouped by the attribute(s).
+
`group_variance (revenue, customer region)`

== Flexible aggregation

The `group_aggregate` function gives you more control over aggregation and filtering.

See xref:formulas-aggregation-flexible.adoc[Flexible aggregation] to learn more about specifying `query_groups` with this formula.

== Limitations of group aggregation functions

Group aggregation functions have the following limitations:

* You can't run SpotIQ analysis on a visualization that contains a group aggregation function.

* You can't create a KPI chart with a group aggregation function.

* ThoughtSpot doesn't support table aggregate headlines for formulas that have group aggregates and are conditional.

* You can't run a `vs` query that also contains a group aggregation function.

* You can't run a group aggregation function on a group aggregation function.
