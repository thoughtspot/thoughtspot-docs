Learn about your SMC hardware before deploying ThoughtSpot.

[#about-hardware]
== About the hardware

You can deploy ThoughtSpot on two different appliance hardware platforms: Haswell and Skylake.
Both of the platforms provide the same performance.
Refer to <<hardware-details,Haswell and Skylake hardware details>> for details on their physical differences.

[#haswell-front-back-diagrams]
== Haswell front and back views

These images show the front and back views of each appliance.

The nodes on the front of both appliances go from A-D left to right.
For this Haswell appliance, only Node D is populated.

The nodes on the back of both appliances are in a reverse N shape, with Node A at the bottom right and Node D at the top left.

The Haswell appliance shown here is not fully populated, as it only has three nodes.
Your appliance may be populated with 1-4 nodes, depending on the ordered configuration.
If you order less than four nodes, ThoughtSpot fills the empty slot with a filler panel.

[#skylake-front-back-diagrams]
== Skylake front and back views

image:smc-skylake-back-view.png[The back of the Skylake appliance]

The Skylake appliance shown here is fully populated with four nodes.

[#smc-serial-number]
== Location of serial number

You may need to know your appliance's serial number, to be able to access online help from your appliance provider.
Find your Super Micro Computer's serial number on the top of the appliance, above the label for Node D at the front right corner.
