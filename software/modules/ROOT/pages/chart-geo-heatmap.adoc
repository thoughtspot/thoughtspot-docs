Geo heatmap charts display the value of the measure through the depth of color of the area. Use geo heatmap charts to see the relative value or density of a measure by location (for example, "sales" relative to "customer zip code").

To use the geo heatmap chart, your search must include a geographical column, or a longitude and latitude pair. ThoughtSpot supports geographical visualizations for many countries; see xref:geomap-reference.adoc[Geo map reference] for details.

See also the full introduction to xref:chart-geo.adoc[] and the specifics of working with them.

== Limitations
Geo heatmap charts do *_NOT_* support conditional formatting.
