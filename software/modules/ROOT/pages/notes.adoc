ThoughtSpot certifies Amazon Linux 2 on the AWS platform.
To deploy ThoughtSpot on Amazon Linux 2, you must have the Ansible tarball;
you can obtain the tarball through your ThoughtSpot contact.

ThoughtSpot now supports charts and tables with more than 1000 data values.
You can easily understand how much of the data your chart or table displays.

* Your search in table form can now have more than 1000 rows.
* Your charts now come with a horizontal scroll bar, to support up to 35,000 data points.
* You can have up to 250 distinct legend items on a chart.
