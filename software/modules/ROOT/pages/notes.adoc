[#analyst-8-4-1-sw]
=== For the Analyst

Table formatting for downloaded tables::
When you download a table in XLSX format, the downloaded table now shows the same column width, number formatting based on the format pattern, and date formatting as the table in ThoughtSpot. Refer to xref:search-download.adoc[Download your search].

[#data-engineer-8-4-1-sw]
=== For the Data Engineer

OAuth for Databricks::

Databricks connections now support OAuth.

Okta OAuth for Snowflake::

Snowflake connections now support Okta OAuth.
For more information, see xref:connections-snowflake-okta-oauth.adoc[Configure Okta OAuth for a Snowflake connection].

[#data-workspace]
Data Workspace::
The new Data Workspace is now GA and on by default. It redesigns the *Data* section of the product. To access it, select *Data* from the top navigation bar. The redesign introduces several new features, such as SQL-based views and dbt integration, and makes the UI more intuitive.
+
See xref:data-workspace.adoc[Data workspace].

[#sql-views]
SQL-based views::
SQL-based views are now GA and on by default. Users can create views based on custom SQL queries, and use those views as data sources. This type of view has the same functionality as a view based on searching your data.
+
See xref:sql-views.adoc[SQL views].

[#dbt]
Integration with dbt::
The dbt integration is now GA and on by default. You can provide your existing dbt models and automatically create worksheets in ThoughtSpot that you can use to perform searches on your data.
+
See xref:dbt-integration.adoc[dbt integration].

[#external-tables]
Query external tables::
ThoughtSpot now supports querying external tables in data stores, after you create these tables in your Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery, or Snowflake environments.
+
For more information, refer to the following articles:

* xref:connections-gbq-external-tables.adoc[]
* xref:connections-redshift-external-tables.adoc[]
* xref:connections-snowflake-external-tables.adoc[]

[#it-ops-engineer-8-4-1-sw]
=== For the IT Ops Engineer

Python 3.9 upgrade::
For ThoughtSpot-managed CentOS clusters hosted on AWS, Azure, and GCP, Python 3.9 is now the default Python version. ThoughtSpot does not support downgrading to an earlier Python release for these clusters. For customer-managed RHEL, OEL, or Amazon Linux 2 clusters, and for ThoughtSpot-managed CentOS clusters hosted on VMware, SMC, and Dell, the default Python version is still either 3.6 or 3.7.  For customer-managed RHEL and Amazon Linux 2 clusters, you can xref:python-upgrade.adoc[upgrade the cluster's Python version to 3.9].

System information Liveboards::
We moved several system monitoring Liveboards to new areas of the product. The *System information and usage Liveboard* is now in the Admin Console, under *System Information*. The *Table status Liveboard* is now in the Admin Console, under *Table Status*. The *Connections Liveboard* is now in the Data Workspace, under *Usage statistics*.
For more information, see xref:admin-portal.adoc[Admin Console] and xref:data-workspace.adoc#usage-statistics[Data workspace].

VMware ESXi 7.0 support::
ThoughtSpot now certifies VMware vSphere Hypervisor (ESXi) 7.0 for VMware deployments of the ThoughtSpot product. ThoughtSpot certifies VMware 7.0 only for ThoughtSpot version 8.4.1.sw. See xref:vmware.adoc[].

[#developer-8-4-1-sw]

=== For the Analyst

Date interval functions::
In this release, we introduced new functions for computing time intervals between two dates. In addition to the existing xref:formula-reference.adoc#diff_days[diff_days] and xref:formula-reference.adoc#diff_time[diff_time] functions, you can now use `diff_years`, `diff_quarters`, `diff_months` `diff_weeks`, `diff_hours`, and `diff_minutes` to calculate time intervals at these additional granularities.
+
If your organization uses a xref:connections-cust-cal.adoc[custom calendar], which can specify a new starting date of a year, starting dates of quarters, a starting day of the month, and a starting day of the week, use the optional custom calendar argument with these functions to calculate the difference between the two dates.
+
Refer to xref:formula-reference.adoc#date-functions[Formula reference date functions].

Conditional and number formatting for downloaded tables::
When you download a table in `XLSX` format, the downloaded table now shows the same conditional and number formatting as the table in ThoughtSpot. Refer to xref:search-download.adoc#table-formatting[Download your search].

Liveboard schedule::
ThoughtSpot now combines the Liveboard follow and xref:liveboard-schedule.adoc[Liveboard Schedule] features into a single action called "Schedule." To create a new schedule to receive an email containing a pdf of your Liveboard, users now select the *Schedule* button to the left of the *more options menu* image:icon-more-10px.png[].
+
ThoughtSpot will migrate any existing Liveboard follows to Liveboard schedules. For users who followed a Liveboard in November Cloud or earlier, those Liveboard schedules appear in the list of Liveboard schedules as _Migrated from follow (your display name)_.

New SpotIQ experience::
The new SpotIQ experience is now available. The functionality remains the same, but we reorganized the UI to make it more intuitive. The new experience is off by default, but you can manage your individual SpotIQ experience xref:user-profile.adoc#spotiq[from your profile]. Note that the new SpotIQ experience is dependent on the xref:answer-experience-new.adoc[new answer experience]; to use the new SpotIQ experience, you must first enable the new answer experience. For more information, refer to xref:spotiq.adoc[SpotIQ].

New answer experience::
The xref:answer-experience-new.adoc[new answer experience] is now available. It contains multiple new features and feature enhancements.
It is part of ThoughtSpot's move to a new stack. The new experience is *_off_* by default, but you can manage your individual answer experience xref:user-profile.adoc#new-answer-experience[from your profile].
To learn more about the new answer experience, refer to xref:answer-experience-new.adoc[].
+
The new answer experience contains the following features:
+
include::partial$new-answer-experience-features.adoc[]

New answer experience deprecations::
include::partial$new-answer-experience-deprecations.adoc[]

Streamlined analyst setup::
We simplified the steps to set up an analyst account on ThoughtSpot. Now, you can create a connection, xref:worksheet-create-setup.adoc[create a worksheet] to model your business use cases, immediately search your data, and automatically xref:automated-answer-creation.adoc[create Search visualizations]. See xref:analyst-onboarding.adoc[Analyst Onboarding] for further details.
+
This feature is specific to clusters based on connections to external data warehouses, not imported data (Falcon). To enable this feature for your cluster, contact {support-url}.

[#business-user-8-4-0-sw]
=== For the Business User

Starting in May 2022, ThoughtSpot refers to Liveboards instead of pinboards. With Liveboards, you can have an interactive experience and get granular insights through live queries on cloud data, tailored for you. You can use Liveboards to iterate, explore, and drill into more insights, and tell a continuously evolving data story. +
ThoughtSpot plans to support for several releases, and then retire, internal processes and external methods that use the older naming convention.

Key Performance Indicator (KPI) chart type::

You can now create visualizations of your data’s Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). When you search for a measure with a time-related keyword (for example, `Sales weekly`), you can create sparkline visualizations of your data’s Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). ThoughtSpot also supports conditional formatting to add visual cues for KPIs or threshold metrics to easily show where you are falling short or exceeding targets. For more information, see xref:chart-kpi.adoc[].

Auto-select search data source for new users::
When a new user first uses xref:search.adoc[Search], ThoughtSpot intelligently selects a data source for them to search on. ThoughtSpot chooses the most popular data source in the cluster that the user has access to. This allows users to begin to search data easily, without looking through all the existing data sources on their cluster.

Geo map support for France postcode::

We now support more detailed geographic maps for France. You can now create maps based on postal codes, as well as region and city name. For more information, see xref:geomap-reference.adoc#france[Geo map reference].
