[#6-0-5-new]
== 6.0.5 New Features and Functionality

=== Set a relay host for SMTP

You can now specify a custom port to connect to the SMTP relay host. If you do not specify a port, the system uses the default recommended port, port 25. Use a custom port if port 25 is blocked in your environment.

See xref:set-up-relay-host.adoc[Set the relay host for SMTP].

=== Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)

Starting with the 6.0.5 release, ThoughtSpot runs with RHEL 7.7 or RHEL 7.8. See https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/7.8_release_notes/index[RHEL 7.8 Release notes,window=_blank].

=== Disable items in embedded ThoughtSpot

You can now disable any of the following items when ThoughtSpot is embedded:

- Share
- Copy a link
- Send feedback

Contact ThoughtSpot support to enable this feature.

=== Embrace advanced configuration

In this release, on the connection details page, you can provide additional key-value pairs that you need to set up the connection to your external data source. Any key-value pairs that you enter must be defined in the external data source. Key-value pairs are case-sensitive.

Some examples of key-value pairs for Snowflake, include the following:

Setting up a proxy connection:

Applying a filter on the schema:

image::snowflake-adv-config-2.png[]

=== Set limits on the number of rows that ThoughtSpot loads

In this release, you can now set a limit on the number of rows ThoughtSpot loads initially for visualizations. This can reduce the load time of visualizations that have many rows, and tend to load slowly.

Contact ThoughtSpot support to enable this feature.

=== OpenLDAP authentication

ThoughtSpot now integrates with OpenLDAP for user authentication. LDAP provides security and makes user management more centralized. To enable user authentication through OpenLDAP, xref:contact.adoc[contact ThoughtSpot Support].

For a complete list of issues that we fixed in this release, see xref:fixed.adoc#6-0-4[6.0.4 Fixed issues].

=== Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)

This release of ThoughtSpot introduces deployment support for https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/linux-platforms/enterprise-linux[RHEL 7.7,window=_blank].
This decouples the OS and application files we shipped together in previous releases, and gives you the flexibility to run ThoughtSpot on an RHEL 7.7 image that your organization manages internally.
ThoughtSpot certifies RHEL 7.7 on the following platforms:

* ThoughtSpot-configured appliances, both DELL hardware and SMC hardware
* Cloud deployments: AWS and GCP
* VMware

RHEL support is in the Early Access phase.
To deploy ThoughtSpot on RHEL, you must have the Ansible tarball;

=== Embrace for Google BigQuery and Microsoft Azure Synapse

In addition to Snowflake and Redshift, you can now run live queries against Google BigQuery or Microsoft Azure Synapse Analytics, without caching data in ThoughtSpot.
You can then analyze this data, and create Answers and Pinboards.

See xref:embrace-intro.adoc[Embrace overview].

=== Embrace enhancements

* *Search indexing* Starting with release 6.0.2, we enabled search indexing of columns by default, in all Embrace connections.
This shows values of columns in the search bar as you type.
+
ThoughtSpot re-indexes columns daily;
this can be changed to an hourly schedule.

* *UI/UX for creating and editing* Embrace connections now include a built-in workflow.
* *Headline optimization* We changed the behavior for loading headlines with tabular reports.
The primary table now loads immediately, and headlines appear when the queries that populate them complete.

=== Data Search APIs

To programmatically use the data that we retrieve from a query, you can use ThoughtSpot Search Data API.

See xref:search-data-api.adoc[Search Data API].

[#6-new]

=== Monitor Headlines

The Monitor feature enables you to follow headline metrics, and get daily updates in your mailbox, on your ThoughtSpot home page, and in the SpotIQ Follow management interface.

For more information, see xref:monitor-headlines.adoc[Monitor headlines].

*Support for Monitor is in beta*.

* To monitor headlines, click the *Follow* icon in the top right corner of the insight.
* The *SpotIQ Follow* interface lists all the headlines you follow, and the changes from last run.
* Click each headline to see the detailed performance over time, examine each interval, all at the time scale you choose.
And you can change to table view, or to another chart type to better visualize your changing metric.

=== Chart Configuration

This release introduces a complete new approach that makes chart configuration much easier and more intuitive.
For more information, see xref:change-the-chart.adoc[Changing Charts].

=== Scriptable Worksheets

You can now *Export* Worksheets by downloading them to a `*.yaml` file, make changes, and then *Update* the Worksheet from the changed file either to the same cluster, or to a new cluster.

Scriptable Worksheets support metadata migration from development to production environments, enables changes that are not possible within the user interface, and lets you perform bulk changes to the metadata (renaming, duplication).

See xref:worksheet-export.adoc[Migrate or restore Worksheets], and xref:yaml-worksheet.adoc[Worksheet YAML specification].

=== Welcome new users

Administrators can configure a welcoming experience for new users.
In addition to assigning a user to the most relevant groups and Pinboards, they can customize a Welcome email to introduce them to ThoughtSpot and help them get started.

=== Google Cloud Platform GCS persistent storage

You can now reduce the cost of a GCP deployment by using GCS for storage of major services like the ThoughtSpot database and search engine.
For more information, see xref:configuration-options-gcp.adoc[GCP configuration options].

=== Streamlined GCP data loading from a GCS bucket

You can now load data from a Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket into your ThoughtSpot GCP instance.

* *Navigation*: Column names appear separately from search values.
Undo steps back to the last change.
Copy and edit retains all changes.
Seamlessly switch from Answer Explorer to search.

Refer to xref:answer-explorer.adoc[Answer Explorer].

=== Homepage Insights for everyone

This release of ThoughtSpot leverages existing insights that are generated by the SpotIQ power users, and shares them with everyone on their Homepage, regardless of that person's access to SpotIQ Analyze function.

These insights are diverse, and cover a wider range of data sources and types.

=== Ask an Expert

We improved the Expert feature by adding more email notifications, enriching email content, and directly linking from emails to requests.

* When a user creates a request, both that user and designated experts get an email notification.
The *Open request* link in the expert's leads directly to ThoughtSpot, to review and manage the request.
* When an expert resolves the request, both the expert and the user receive an email notification.
The user can then follow the supplied link to navigate directly to the resolved answer.

=== Geo Maps

ThoughtSpot now supports xref:geomap-reference.adoc[Geo Map] visualizations for these new locales:

* *Austria:* State, District, and Postal
* *Italy:* Region, Province/Territories, and Postal Code
