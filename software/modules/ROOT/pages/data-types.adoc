ThoughtSpot supports all the common data types. Before you import data, compare the data types you want to load from the source with the ones we support.
Then, convert your data before loading it.
Typically, you would export the data, transform it to meet these type rules, and then load the data.
This is known as an extract-transform-load process.

== Supported data types

The tables you create to receive the data must have the same number of columns and data types as the data you will be loading.
Choose a data type for each column from the list of supported data types:

[#text]
Character or Text::
[#varchar]`VARCHAR(*n*)`
+
Specify the maximum number of characters, as in `VARCHAR(255)`.
+
The size limit is 64MB for `VARCHAR` values.
+
WARNING: If you have `VARCHAR` data that exceeds the 64MB limit, the entire load fails.

[#decimal]
Floating point or Decimal::
[#double]`DOUBLE` or
[#float]`FLOAT`
+
We recommend that you use `DOUBLE`, because it has a range of 15 significant digits, `1.7E +/- 308`. `FLOAT` has a range of 7 significant digits, `3.4E +/- 38`.

[#boolean]
Boolean::
[#bool]`BOOL`
+
Can be `true` or `false`.

[#integer]
Integer::
[#int]`INT` or
[#bigint]`BIGINT`
+
`INT` holds 32 bits. It has a range of `-2,147,483,648` to `2,147,483,647`.
+
`BIGINT` holds 64 bits. It has a range of `-9,223,372,036,854,775,808` to `9,223,372,036,854,775,807`.

[#date]
Date or time::
[#date]`DATE`,
[#datetime]`DATETIME`,
[#timestamp]`TIMESTAMP`, or
[#time]`TIME`
+
ThoughtSpot stores `DATETIME`, `TIMESTAMP`, and `TIME` at the granularity of seconds. `TIMESTAMP` is identical to `DATETIME`; we include it for syntax compatibility.

[#geo]
== Geographical data types

ThoughtSpot supports geographical data.

=== How to import geographical data

Import your geographical data as *text* values. This ensures that the data defaults to the correct configuration, where the data type is `VARCHAR`.

You can use `DOUBLE` or `VARCHAR` for latitude and longitude data. See the following example:

image::geoconfig-zipcodes.png[Geo data example]

Here, the zip codes were imported as text values. By default, the `data type` is `VARCHAR`, the `column type` is `attribute`, and `additive` is `no`.

[NOTE]
====
* You *must* specify the `geo config` for the data. ThoughtSpot does not specify geo config automatically.
* If you import zip codes as numeric values, the `column type` defaults to  `measure`. Because `measures` are numeric values used in mathematical formulas and as default aggregations, you *must* change the `column type` to `attribute` and specify `additive` as `no`.
====

[#lat-long]
=== Latitude and longitude

For latitude and longitude, you can use either `VARCHAR` or `DOUBLE`.

[width="100%",cols="60%,40%",frame="none",grid="none"]
|===
| Latitude and longitude data must be in the form of positive and negative numbers, most commonly decimals, NOT in degree / minute / second notation.
North of the Equator, latitude values are *positive*, and south of the Equator, latitude values are *negative*.
East of the Prime Meridian, longitude values are *positive*, and West of the Prime Meridian, longitude values are *negative*. a|

=== Designate geographical data

After loading the data, designate it as a geographical data type when you xref:data-modeling-edit.adoc[edit the system-wide data model].

[NOTE]
====
* Wherever using abbreviations or codes, ThoughtSpot  conforms the USPS (United States Postal Service) standards.
* You cannot upload your own custom boundaries.
====

These data types can be designated as geographical data, which enables them to be visualized using the Geo chart types:

* xref:country[Country]
* xref:sub[Sub-nation region], such as State, County, Zip Code, Province, Prefecture, District, and so on.
* xref:latitude[Latitude]
* xref:longitude[Longitude]

[#country]
Country::
  Countries, such as United States:
[horizontal]
 `long name`::: United States
`name_sort`::: United States of America
`abbreviation`::: U.S.A.
`adm0_a3`::: USA
`adm0_a3_is`::: USA
`adm0_a3_us`::: USA
`admin`::: United States of America
`brk_a3`::: USA
`brk_name`::: United States
`formal_en`::: United States of America
`iso_a2`::: US
`iso_a3`::: USA
`iso_n3`::: 840

[#sub]
Sub-nation region::
  Regions could be Countries, States, districts, zip codes, postal codes, provinces (for example, in Canada), prefectures (in Japan), and so on.
