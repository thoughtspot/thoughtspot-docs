= Architecture components

To implement ThoughtSpot it is important to understand where it sits within your overall analytics architecture and how it provides data to end users.
ThoughtSpot consists of a cluster of one or more nodes, acting together to provide analytic answers to business questions.
As such, there are only a few integration points with ThoughtSpot on your network.
The major components in a ThoughtSpot cluster are:

ThoughtSpot can handle a wide variety of different data sources.
ThoughtSpot does all analysis against data in memory to help achieve fast results across millions and billions of records of data.
ThoughtSpot caches the data in order to process it.

The ThoughtSpot appliance can be a physical appliance that ThoughtSpot ships, one or more AWS instances that are clustered together, or one or more VMware instances that are clustered together.
From an external interface, regardless of the appliance type, the appliance appears to be a single instance.

For authentication (logging in), some source of user information is required.
These define the login requirements and access control groups.
Users must access the data from a supported browser to view saved content, or perform searched-based analytics.
Finally, it is recommended that you have some sort of networked attached storage for storing backups in case of hardware failure.
