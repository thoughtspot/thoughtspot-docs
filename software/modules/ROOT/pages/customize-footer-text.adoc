You can customize ThoughtSpot's footer test to add a company-specific message.

It also appears with an embed application that encompasses an individual Liveboard or a full application.
In embed applications that have a single visualization, you can ask your {support-url} engineer to disable the footer.

While you cannot remove the footer, you can customize it by adding a company-specific message.
