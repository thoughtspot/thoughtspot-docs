You can customize ThoughtSpot's footer text to add a company-specific message.

The ThoughtSpot footer appears by default in the ThoughtSpot application.
It also appears with an embed application that encompasses an individual Liveboard or a full application.
In embed applications that have a single visualization, you can ask your ThoughtSpot support engineer to disable the footer.

While you cannot remove the footer, you can customize it by adding a company-specific message.
