:description: ThoughtSpot supports OAuth for a Databricks connection. This page describes the setup and configuration required.

ThoughtSpot supports OAuth for a {connection} connection. This page describes the setup and configuration required.

{connection} SQL warehouses are configured with OAuth 2.0 authentication on the Microsoft Azure platform, using Azure Active Directory (AAD) as the identity provider (IdP).

== Part 1: Create an application in AAD

To create an application in AAD, do the following:

. Log in to the Azure portal and navigate to the AAD resource, click *Add*, and select *App registration*.

. Provide a name for your application and add a redirect URI in the following format:
+
`\https://<your-thoughtspot-instance>/callosum/v1/connection/generateTokens`
+
This is where the call is redirected upon successful login to AAD when creating a connection in ThoughtSpot.

. After you register your application, make a note of the *Application (client) ID* in the Essentials section of the appâ€™s overview page. Also, make a note of the OAuth 2.0 authorization and token endpoints. These are required later when configuring the {connection} connection in ThoughtSpot.

== Part 2: Configure the AAD application

To configure the AAD application, do the following:

. In the Azure portal, navigate to your application by clicking *App Registrations* and then clicking your newly registered application to open it.
+

. In your application, click *API Permissions* and under the *AzureDatabricks* API/Permissions name, click the *user_impersonation* permission.
+

. Click *Certificates & secrets* and create a new secret for the app, providing an appropriate expiry time. Make a note of the secret value because it is displayed _only_ while creating it. The secret value is required later when you create the {connection} connection in ThoughtSpot.

.Setting the scope of the authorization flow
****

In the authorization code flow for OAuth, the scope must be set with this resource id:

== Part 3: Create AAD users in the {connection} workspace

To create AAD users in the {connection} workspace, do the following:

. Log in to the {connection} workspace as a user with admin privileges. Click *Setting* and navigate to *Admin Console*.
. Click *Add User* to create AAD users in {connection}.

== Part 4: Connect the client using the OAuth token

The JDBC connection URL which uses the access token from AAD must use the following format:
[source]
----
`"jdbc:spark://adb-111222444555.13.azuredatabricks.net:443/samples;transportMode=http;" +
"ssl=1;httpPath=/sql/1.0/endpoints/c53335555f2222e999;" +
"AuthMech=11;Auth_Flow=0;" +"Auth_AccessToken=<access_token>"`
