System monitoring tools in ThoughtSpot include several Liveboards in the Admin Console and system logs. Additionally, ThoughtSpot provides several worksheets and out-of-the-box system monitoring Liveboards. From these worksheets, you can create your own custom visualizations and Liveboards. This section introduces these features and directs you towards more detailed information.

== Admin Console
The ThoughtSpot application includes an *Admin Console* center, where you can easily monitor usage, alerts, events and general cluster health. Navigate to the *Admin Console* by selecting *Admin* from the top navigation bar.

Only users with administrative privileges can view the *Admin Console*. However, administrative users can present the information in the *Admin Console* to others.

Administrators can also create their own, custom Liveboards that reflect system data in ways that are meaningful to specific departments or groups. For more information, see the following documentation:

* xref:system-info-usage.adoc[Health Overview board]
* xref:system-data.adoc[Data board]
* xref:cluster-manager.adoc[Cluster Manager board]
* xref:system-alerts-events.adoc[Alerts and Events board]
* xref:system-worksheet.adoc[System Worksheets]
* xref:system-liveboards.adoc[System Liveboards]
* xref:falcon-monitor.adoc[Falcon monitoring Liveboards]
* xref:performance-tracking.adoc[Performance Tracking Liveboard]

Much of the data presented by these boards is also available through tscli commands see xref:tscli-command-ref.adoc[tscli Command Reference].

== Log files
Many of the administration commands output logging information to log files. The logs get written into the fixed directory `/export/logs/`, with a sub-directory for each subsystem. The individual log directories follow:

* `/export/logs/orion`
* `/export/logs/oreo`
* `/export/logs/hadoop`
* `/export/logs/zookeeper`

You can also view [additional topics that also touch on log files throughout the documentation.

== System monitoring notifications

You can configure ThoughtSpot to send emails to addresses you specify with monitoring reports and a cluster heartbeat. Follow these steps to xref:monitoring-setup.adoc[Set up monitoring].
