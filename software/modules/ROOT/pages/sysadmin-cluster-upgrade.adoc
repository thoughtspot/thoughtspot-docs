xref:support-contact.adoc[Contact ThoughtSpot Support] to upgrade a cluster to a new release.

ThoughtSpot is installed or updated from a release tarball that contains the ThoughtSpot application (binaries and configuration), third-party software, and Operating System image.
Third party softwares are licensed software components necessary for operation of the ThoughtSpot application.
These include Java, Boost C{pp} libraries, Google protocol buffers, and so on.

ThoughtSpot patches the Operating System at the time of upgrades.
Installation and upgrade use the same process, replacing the older OS image on a node by the new image delivered in the release tarball.

ThoughtSpot Support will contact you to schedule an update when a minor or major upgrade becomes available.

You can also view available releases from the Admin Console.
To view new releases, navigate to the Admin Console by clicking on the *Admin* tab from the top navigation bar.
Select *Upgrade* from the side navigation bar that appears.

The *Upgrade* page shows your cluster's current version, and any new releases that are available.
If no releases are available, you see the following screen.
