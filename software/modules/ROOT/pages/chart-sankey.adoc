The Sankey chart type contains both columns and a special type of line chart.

Sankey diagrams illustrate a flow through, a process, or a system. Transactional data is optimal for this type of diagram. For example, financial transactions that take place as money moves through accounts or as a product is processed. Many marketing users are familiar with Sankey charts as they analyze sales conversions.

When you build a Sankey chart, you must provide at least 2 (two) attributes and one measure. Your x-axis attributes can contain at most 13 values; any more and you cannot view a SanKey chart. ThoughtSpot Sankey charts are read from left to right.
The width of the flow represents the measure, the attributes or "steps" appear as solid bars:

The chart shows how the animal's classification when they entered the system predicts the outcome.

By clicking on each flow, you can see the total number of animals that have identical breed and outcome types.
