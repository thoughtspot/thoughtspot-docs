To provide richer insights, you can add a formula to your ThoughtSpot search.

The Formula Builder includes many types of operators, such as logical (if, then, else), math, date, and text string functions.

You can create a formula from directly within a search.
If you have the privilege that allows you to create or edit Worksheets, you can also create a formula within a Worksheet.
Formulas in Worksheets act as derived columns, so that anyone who uses the Worksheet as a data source will see the formula as just another column.

Adding a formula within a search works much the same way as adding a formula to a Worksheet.
However, you will be able to edit the formula directly from within the answer.
If you add the answer to a pinboard and share it with the *Edit* privilege, other people can see the formula results, too.
To make edits to the formula, they also need to have the *Edit* privilege on the underlying data.

The following list of topics explain concepts and give step-by-step instructions of how to work with formulas. We also recommend that you review our comprehensive coverage of all formulas in the xref:formula-reference.adoc[Formula function reference], which provides brief descriptions and examples for all supported formulas, by type.

xref:how-to-add-formula.adoc[Add a formula to a search]::
You can add a formula directly within a search.
Some common reasons for using a formula in a search are to perform mathematical functions, check for and replace null values, or add if...then...else logic.

xref:edit-formula-in-answer.adoc[View or edit a formula in a search]::
You can always go back and view or edit a formula that has been added to a search.
Do this by clicking the edit icon next to its name in the *Columns* listing.
xref:formulas-aggregation.adoc[About aggregate formulas]::
When working with formulas, it is useful to understand the difference between regular (or row-wise) formulas and aggregation formulas.
xref:conversion-formulas.adoc[About conversion formulas]::
Some formulas require the input to be of a particular data type.
If you find that you want to pass a value to the function, but it is of the wrong data type, you can convert it using a conversion formula.
xref:date-formulas.adoc[About date formulas]::
Date formulas allow you to apply date related functions to your formulas.
xref:percent-calculations.adoc[Percent calculations]::
Use number functions to perform useful percent calculations.
xref:conditional-sum.adoc[About conditional formulas (operators)]
Conditional formulas, or operators, allow you to apply `if`/`then`/`else` conditions in your formulas.
xref:about-nested-formulas.adoc[About nested formulas]::
Nested formulas, or formula on formula, allow you to reference a formula inside another formula.
xref:about-formula-support-for-chasm-trap-schemas.adoc[About formula support for chasm trap schemas]::
You can create a formula that involves aggregated measures coming from multiple fact tables of a chasm trap.
Text formulas::
ThoughtSpot also uses text formulas.
