:description: Everywhere in ThoughtSpot where you can run SpotIQ analyze, you can configure a customized SpotIQ analysis.


NOTE: The new SpotIQ experience is now available, but off by default. The functionality remains the same in the new experience, but we reorganized the UI to make it more intuitive. You can manage your individual SpotIQ experience xref:user-profile.adoc#spotiq[from your profile]. Note that the new SpotIQ experience is dependent on the xref:answer-experience-new.adoc[new answer experience]; to use the new SpotIQ experience, you must first enable the new answer experience. If you are using the classic SpotIQ or answer experiences, your experience may be different from the one this article describes.

Everywhere in ThoughtSpot where you can run *SpotIQ analyze*, you can configure a customized SpotIQ analysis.
The customized analysis can be a one-time customization or can apply to all future analysis of that particular data source.

== Finding customization controls

Every menu or location where you can run *SpotIQ analyze*, you can customize your analysis.
You access it from the more menu image:icon-more-10px.png[SpotIQ analyze icon] > SpotIQ analyze.

== SpotIQ window layout

Depending on where you run *SpotIQ Analyze* in ThoughtSpot, the SpotIQ analysis window has a different layout.

[#new-answer-experience]
=== SpotIQ from an answer or search

. On the new answer experience, when you access SpotIQ from an answer or search, the SpotIQ analysis window first asks you what kind of analysis you would like to do:
+
image::spotiq-analyze-choose.png[Choose type of analysis]
+
* Outlier analysis: finds underlying anomalies or outliers
* Trend analysis: finds interesting trends in the underlying data
* Cross-correlation analysis: determines how your metrics correlate with other measures
* Change analysis: if you select 2 or more data points, you can run a change analysis on those points. Otherwise, ThoughtSpot does not show you this option.

. Next, SpotIQ recommends certain columns for analysis. You can select all columns in the Answer, clear all columns, or search for more columns to include.
+

. You can also customize advanced parameters. Select *Customize parameters*, on the *Select measures and attributes* page. The following screen appears. Scroll down to see more options, including customizations for specific analysis types.

--
* Outlier algorithm: choose the method of outlier detection (z-scores or median z-scores, Seasonal Hybrid ESD, or Linear Regression)

* Outlier parameters: choose the minimum rows required for analysis, multiplier for outlier detection, and maximum P-Value

* Insight count settings: choose the maximum outlier detection insights, maximum seasonality detection insights, and maximum linear regression insights
--
+
You can customize the following parameters for a *trend analysis:*
+
--
* Trend parameters: specify the minimum rows required for analysis, maximum P-Value, and minimum relative difference

* Insight count settings: specify the maximum trend insights
--
+

You can customize the following parameters for a *cross-correlation analysis:*
+
--
* Cross-correlation parameters: choose the minimum rows required for analysis, minimum correlation coefficient, maximum correlation coefficient, and maximum correlation lag

* Insight count settings: choose the maximum cross-correlation insights
--
+
You can customize the following parameters for a *change analysis:*

[#classic-experience]
=== SpotIQ from a Liveboard

When you access SpotIQ from a Liveboard, or in the classic answer or SpotIQ experience, the SpotIQ analysis window has two tabs:

* *Columns*, where you can explicitly indicate which columns to include in a SpotIQ analysis.
(You can select all, some, or none.)
* *Advanced*, where you can run custom analyses and incorporate R scripts [.label.label-dep]#Deprecated 8.4.0.sw [LA]# into SpotIQ.

The *Advanced* tab has many options.
The panel scrolls, so more algorithms are available than appear in the following image.

The *SpotIQ* insights page has an option to open this window to customize a single analysis.

The *Tell us more* window provides information on how to exclude a value from all future analysis.

You can set SpotIQ customization parameters in your xref:spotiq-preferences.adoc[SpotIQ preferences], along with options for email notifications when analyses run:

Eliminate null values::
  Null values should be eliminated from your analysis.
  From next analysis;; In the *Search* bar, add a filter `column!= Null` to the search bar. Or choose *Exclude null values from current analysis*, using the *Advanced* panel.
  From future analyses;; Set *Exclude null values from my analysis* on your user *Profile* to exclude them from any future SpotIQ analyses you do.

Exclude uninteresting column(s) in insight::
  You should always exclude columns you are not interested from your analysis.
  From next analysis;; Use the *EXCLUDE* option of *SPOTIQ PREFERENCE* under the *DATA* tab to exclude any column permanently from all future analysis.
  From future analyses;; Not applicable.

Include an interesting column::
  You can always include columns that interest you in your analysis.
  From next analysis;; Choose *Customize analysis* and select columns that you want to include.
  From future analyses;; Ensure *Index Priority* is between 8-10 on the column under the *DATA* tab.

Remove known date outliers::
  Your data may contain known outliers.
+
For example, you are in the middle of a quarter and only want to analyze the previous quarter. Anything from the present quarter could contain an outlier.
  From next analysis;; In the *Search* bar, add a filter date< last time period to the search bar.
  From future analyses;; Not applicable.

Too few insights::
  Your SpotIQ analysis may not provide you as many insights as you think it should.
  From next analysis;; Choose *Customize analysis*, select the *Advanced tab*, and decrease the *Multiplier for Outlier Detection* to a value closer to zero.
  From future analyses;; Not applicable.
