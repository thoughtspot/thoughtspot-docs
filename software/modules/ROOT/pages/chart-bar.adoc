Bar charts are like xref:chart-column.adoc[column charts], but oriented horizontally.

The bar chart is very similar to the column chart.
The only difference is that it is oriented horizontally, instead of vertically.

Bar charts display your data using horizontal rectangular bars.
The length of the bar is proportional to the data value.
