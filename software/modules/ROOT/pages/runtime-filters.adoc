Runtime filters allow you to filter an answer or pinboard through parameters you pass in the URL, to filter the returned data.

This approach works both with the Data API, and with embedded answers and pinboards.

== Capabilities of runtime filters

Runtime filters provide ability to filter data at the time of retrieval using xref:embedding.adoc[embedding] or the xref:data-api.adoc[REST API].
This is done by providing filter information through the URL query parameters.

This example shows the URL to access a pinboard with a filter.
Here the Runtime Filter is operating on the column "Color" and will only return values that are equal (EQ) to "red".

This example shows the URL for a REST API call with a filter.
Here the Runtime Filter is operating on the column `Category` and returning values that are equal to `mfgr%2324`.

ThoughtSpot will try to find a matching column from the pinboard or visualization being accessed, using the `col` field as `name`.
You can add any number of filter sets by incrementing the parameters (for example,
`col2`, `op2`, and `val2`, and so on) For operators that support more than one value you can pass `val1=foo&val1=bar`, and so on.

If the pinboard or answer you're filtering already has one or more filters applied, the runtime filter(s) will act as an `AND` condition.
This means that the data returned must meet the conditions of all filters - those supplied in the runtime filter, and those included in the pinboard or visualization itself.

== Supported Data Types

You can use runtime filters on these data types: xref:data-types.adoc#varchar[`VARCHAR`], xref:data-types.adoc#bigint[`BIGINT`], xref:data-types.adoc#int[`INT`], xref:data-types.adoc#float[`FLOAT`], xref:data-types.adoc#double[`DOUBLE`], xref:data-types.adoc#bool[`BOOLEAN`], xref:data-types.adoc#date[`DATE`], xref:data-types.adoc#datetime[`DATETIME`], and
xref:data-types.adoc#time[`TIME`].

NOTE: You must specify the date in epoch time (also known as POSIX or Unix time) for `DATE` and `DATETIME` values.

== Example Uses

You can use runtime filters alongside the REST API and Embedding to create dynamic controls in your Web portal.
For example, you could use the REST API to get a list of possible filters for a visualization.
Then use that data to populate a select list on your Web portal.
When a user makes a selection, you would then pass it as a Runtime Filter, and the result returned will apply the filter.

== Limitations of runtime filters

Runtime filters do not work directly on top of tables.
You must create a worksheet if you want to use runtime filters.
This means that the pinboard or visualization on which you apply a runtime filter must be created on top of a worksheet.

If the worksheet was created from an answer (it is an aggregated worksheet), runtime filters will only work if the answer was formed using a single worksheet.
If the answer from which the worksheet was created includes raw tables or joins multiple worksheets, you won't be able to use runtime filters on it.
This is because of the join path ambiguity that could result.

CAUTION: Runtime filters do not allow you to apply `having` filters using the URL.

You cannot apply a runtime filter on a pinboard or visualization built on tables whose schema includes a chasm trap.
See the information on handling xref:chasm-trap.adoc[] and xref:formulas-chasm-trap.adoc[].
