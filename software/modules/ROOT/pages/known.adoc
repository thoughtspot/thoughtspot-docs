|Issue ID |Description|Symptoms, conditions, and workaround

|SCAL-139140
|A query with multiple `group_*` formulas mixed with other attribute formulas, and using a worksheet with multiple roots returns data where the same combinations of attribute values correspond to different measure values.
a|*Symptoms*:

Rows of data with the same attribute values appear to have different measure values.

*Conditions*:

Search with multiple `group_*` formulas mixed with other attribute formulas, and using a worksheet with multiple roots. The query schema roots should be different than the worksheet roots.

*Workaround*:

One possible workaround is to reduce the worksheet to the tables needed by the query, or until the worksheet schema roots are the same as the query schema roots.

|SCAL-137873
|Locale parameter is not overwritten by `SearchEmbed` when embedding ThoughtSpot.
a|*Symptoms*:

Example:

When the "locale" parameter is set as `en_AU` for the   `<SearchEmbed>` React component, the date is still displaying as mm/dd/yyyy rather than the expected dd/mm/yyyy format per the AU locale. The same parameter is used for the `<LiveboardEmbed>` component and it correctly displays the date.

*Conditions*:

N/A

*Workaround*:
None
