|SCAL-129737
|Headline summary is truncated despite the number of decimals.
a|*Symptoms*:

Headline with decimal digits is rounded off, causing a loss of accuracy.

*Conditions*:

Headline value is `DOUBLE` type.

*Workaround*:

None

|SCAL-129691
|“UniqueCount is not supported for the current query” error on pinned-headline tiles in a Liveboard.
a|*Symptoms*:

- When editing a pinned visualization, the Edit page shows the entire answer that the pinned headline came from. If the headline summary in the answer page is showing **--**, the selected aggregation is not compatible with the column that it is summarizing.
- Pinning the headline to a Liveboard is not a locked action from the UI. When attempting to retrieve the actual summary, the visualization tile displays the execution error message specified in the *Description* section for this issue instead.

*Conditions*:

- The headline is over a formula column that contains any of the following: `unique_count`, `unique_count_if`, `group_unique_count`, `approx_unique_count`.
- The formula’s unique count portion uses columns that come from tables of a connection to a cloud data warehouse.
- The selected headline aggregation for the formula (the headline visualization at the bottom of the main answer visualization) is Table Aggregate.

*Workaround*:

Set the selected headline aggregation to something other than Table Aggregate. Usually, **TOTAL** is a sufficient replacement for Table Aggregate and better matches customer use cases.
