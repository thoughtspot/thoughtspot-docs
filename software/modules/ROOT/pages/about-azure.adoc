You can host ThoughtSpot on Microsoft Azure.

Microsoft Azure can provide lots of memory and CPU for your ThoughtSpot instance, and it can be easily updated from development instances.

Your database capacity will determine the number of instances you'll need and the memory and storage requirements.
Depending on the amount of data you want to load, you can use multiple nodes together in a single instance.

The security group setting of your ThoughtSpot instance in Azure is up to you.
You can find more information about which ports to open in the xref:ports.adoc[network ports reference].

== A little about Azure

Azure is a secure cloud services platform offered by Microsoft.
Using ThoughtSpot on Azure allows you to easily add instances as your dataset grows.
You can do everything you'd normally want to do in a traditional data center with Azure.
It features an on-demand delivery of IT resources and applications through the Internet.
When you are connected to an instance, you can use it just like you use any other server.

Using Azure lets you develop and deploy applications faster since there is no need to manage hardware.
Therefore, it is easy to scale and manage computing capacity.

Azure uses https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/overview[role based access control (RBAC),window=_blank] to manage permissions on resources.
Permissions are assigned to a https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/overview#scope[scope,window=_blank] in the following hierarchy: Subscription, management group, resource group, and individual resource.
See https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management-groups-overview[Organize your resources,window=_blank] in the Azure documentation for information on how to use this capability.
