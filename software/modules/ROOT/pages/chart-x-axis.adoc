When there are multiple columns on the x- or y-axis or legend of a chart, you can reorder them by using the *Configure Chart* icon.

The order in which columns appear on the axis or legend is based on the sequence they are added.
The first field is used as the primary sorting field for the chart.
Adding another field adds it after the first one on the axis label or legend.
If you want to change the order, you can remove the fields and re-add them in the reverse order.

.[.badge.badge-early-access]#Early Access# Apply multiple chart changes at once
****
To reduce chart reloads and wait time between each chart configuration, we introduced an *Apply* button on the chart configuration panel. Now you can make multiple configurations, and apply them all at the same time. This feature is disabled by default. To enable it, contact your ThoughtSpot administrator. For more about Early Access features, see xref:release-lifecycle.adoc#early-access[ThoughtSpot Software release life cycle].

This example shows you how to reorder the y-axis columns.

. While viewing your Answer as a chart, select the *chart configuration* icon image:icon-gear-10px.png[chart configuration icon] near the upper right.
. Under *Y-axis*, drag and drop the column chips into your preferred order.
