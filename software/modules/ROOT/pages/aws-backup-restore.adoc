= Back up and Restore an AWS cluster using S3
:last_updated: 7/9/2020

Learn how to back up or restore your ThoughtSpot cluster hosted in AWS using an S3 bucket.

It is recommended to use a bucket in the same region as your cluster.
By doing this, you avoid additional cross-region data transfer costs.

NOTE: You can only back up your cluster to an S3 bucket if it is an S3-based cluster.
You cannot back up an HDFS-based cluster to an S3 bucket.
