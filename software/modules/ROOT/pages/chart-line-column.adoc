The line column chart combines xref:chart-column.adoc[column] and xref:chart-line.adoc[line] charts.

The line column chart combines the column and line charts.
Your search needs at least one attribute and two measures to be represented as a line column chart.

Line column charts display one measure as a column chart, and the other as a line chart.
Each of these measures has its own y-axis.

You can choose to enable shared y-axis by clicking the dropdown menu icon image:icon-caret-right-20px.png[] next to the Y-axis label and selecting *Group* for both measures.
