Install ThoughtSpot on RHEL or OEL online clusters.

Before starting the install, make sure that you completed the xref:rhel-prerequisites.adoc[pre-installation steps].

In an online cluster, the hosts can access the public repositories to download the required packages.

Before you build the ThoughtSpot cluster and install the ThoughtSpot application on the hosts, you must run the Ansible playbook. The TS Ansible playbook prepares your clusters in the following manner:

- Ansible installs the required packages: YAML, Python, and R packages; see xref:rhel-packages.adoc[Packages installed with ThoughtSpot for RHEL and OEL].
- It creates and configures local user accounts for ThoughtSpot:
** `admin` user has full administrative functionality
** `thoughtspot` user can load data in the application
- It installs the ThoughtSpot CLI, `tscli`.
- It configures the ThoughtSpot host nodes:
** checks that customization scripts can execute on the nodes
** checks that the partitions meet minimum size requirements

These are the general steps for installing ThoughtSpot on RHEL clusters:

[#configure-ansible]
== Configure the Ansible Playbook

To set up the Ansible, follow these steps:

. Download the Ansible tarball you obtained from {support-url} to your local machine.
. Unzip the Ansible tarball, to see the following files and directories on your local machine:

`customize.sh`:: This runs as the last step in the preparation process. You can use it to inject deployment-specific customizations, such as enabling or disabling a corporate proxy, configuring extra SSH keys, installing extra services, and so on. By default, this script does nothing.

`hosts.sample`::
Ansible inventory file for host configuration.

`prod_image`::
  This directory contains the ThoughtSpot tools and `tscli`, the ThoughtSpot CLI binary.

`README.md`::
  Basic information for the unzipped file

`rpm_gpg`::
  This directory contains the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_network/5.0.0/html/client_configuration_guide/ch-gpg-keys[GPG keys^] that authenticate the public repository.

`toolchain`::
  The tools that are necessary to compile the instructions you define in the Ansible Playbook, the source code, into executables that can run on your device. The toolchain includes a compiler, a linker, and run-time libraries.

`ts-new.yaml`::
  The Ansible Playbook for new installations.

`ts-update.yaml`::
  The Ansible Playbook for updates.

`ts.yaml`::

`yum.repos.d`::
  This directory contains information about the yum repo used by the cluster.

. Copy the Ansible inventory file `hosts.sample` to `hosts.yaml`, and then use a text editor of your choice to update the file to include your host configuration:

`hosts`::
Add the IP addresses or hostnames of all hosts in the ThoughtSpot cluster.

`user_uid`::
Specify the user ID for the user who will set up the node. The default is `1081`.
+
If you do not use the default, add values that are not currently in use. To determine what values your system uses already, run the following command:
+
[source]
----
cat /etc/passwd | cut -d ":" -f3-4| sort
----
`user_gid`::
Specify the user group ID for the user who will set up the node. The default is `1081`.
+
If you do not use the default, add values that are not currently in use. To determine what values your system uses already, run the following command:
+
[source]
----
cat /etc/passwd | cut -d ":" -f3-4| sort
----
`username`::
Specify the username for the user who will set up the node. The default is `admin`.
`groupname`::
Specify the group name for the group who will set up the node. The default is `admin`.
[#ldap_admin_user]
`ldap_admin_user`::
*[optional]* One of three parameters required to enable users to use their OpenLDAP admin user to SSH as an admin, instead of using the local ThoughtSpot admin user, which has sudo privileges. Specify the OpenLDAP admin user, in the form _example@company.com_. You must include all 3 of the LDAP parameters (`ldap_admin_user`, `ldap_server_uri`, `ldap_server_base`), or none of them. If you include 1 or 2, the playbook fails.
`ldap_server_uri`::
*[optional]* One of three parameters required to enable users to use their OpenLDAP admin user to SSH as an admin, instead of using the local ThoughtSpot admin user, which has sudo privileges. Specify the LDAP server uniform resource identifier, in the form _ldap://<ldap_server_IP>_. You must include all 3 of the LDAP parameters (`ldap_admin_user`, `ldap_server_uri`, `ldap_server_base`), or none of them. If you include 1 or 2, the playbook fails.
`ldap_server_base`::
*[optional]* One of three parameters required to enable users to use their OpenLDAP admin user to SSH as an admin, instead of using the local ThoughtSpot admin user, which has sudo privileges. Specify the LDAP server base distinguished name, in the form _dc=<optional_subdomain>_,_dc=<domain>_,_dc=<top-level-domain>_, such as _dc=thoughtspot_,_dc=com_. You must include all 3 of the LDAP parameters (`ldap_admin_user`, `ldap_server_uri`, `ldap_server_base`), or none of them. If you include 1 or 2, the playbook fails.

`ssh_user`::
The `ssh_user` must exist on the ThoughtSpot host, and it must have `sudo` privileges.
On-premise deployments;;
The `ssh_user` is the user who runs the playbook, and who is connected to the hosts.
AWS;;
The same as `ec2_user`.
GCP;;
The `ssh_user` is the user who runs the playbook, and who is connected to the hosts.

`ssh_private_key`::
Add the private key for `ssh` access to the `hosts.yaml` file. You can use an existing key pair, or generate a new key pair in the Ansible Control server.
+
Run the following command to verify that the Ansible Control Server can connect to the hosts over `ssh`:
+
[source]
----
ansible -m ping -i hosts.yaml all
----

`is_user_wheel_group`::
Specifies if the administrator user should be added to the wheel group. The default is `true`. If you specify `false`, the administrator user is not added to the wheel group.

`ssh_public_key`::
Add the public key to the `ssh authorized_keys` file for each host, and add the private key to the `hosts.yaml` file. You can use an existing key pair, or generate a new key pair in the Ansible Control server.
+
Run the following command to verify that the Ansible Control Server can connect to the hosts over `ssh`:
+
[source]
----
ansible -m ping -i hosts.yaml all
----

`extra_admin_ssh_key`::
(Optional) An additional or extra key may be required by your security application, such as Qualys, to connect to the hosts.

`http(s)_proxy`::
If the hosts must access public repositories through an internal proxy service, provide the proxy information.
+
This release of ThoughtSpot does not support proxy credentials to authenticate to the proxy service.

`minimal_sudo_install`::
When this is defined, TS disables certain functionality to avoid making additional sudo calls.  This functionality includes the email notification management system, some cluster statistics reporting, and logging of connectivity status between nodes. The default is undefined.

`external_sudo_manager`::
When this is configured, ThoughtSpot does not make any changes to the sudoers file, such as adding the administrator user. The user is then responsible for ensuring that the administrator user has the ability to run certain elevated privilege commands. The default is undefined.

`skip_sshd_config`::
When this is configured, ThoughtSpot does not make any changes to the sshd configuration of the node.  The user must ensure that the MaxSessions value for the administrator user is at least 10. The default is undefined.

`skip_yum_update`::
When this is defined, the ansible playbook does not attempt to run a blanket yum update to pull the latest packages. The default is undefined.

no_mail_packages::
When this is defined, ThoughtSpot does not install the mail packages mutt and postfix. This only applies for online installations. The default is undefined.

`skip_time_sync_setup`::
When this is defined, ThoughtSpot does not configure time synchronization between nodes using `ntp`. The user must configure time synchronization using either `ntp` or `chronyd` themselves. The default is undefined.

`ts_partition_name`::
The extended name of the ThoughtSpot export partition, such as `/dev/sdb1`.

[#run-ansible]
== Run the Ansible Playbook

Run the Ansible Playbook from your local machine by entering the following command:

[source]
----
ansible-playbook -i hosts.yaml ts.yaml
----

As the Ansible Playbook runs, it will perform these tasks:

. Trigger the installation of xref:rhel-packages.adoc[Yum, Python, and R packages]
. Configure the local user accounts that the ThoughtSpot application uses
. Install the ThoughtSpot CLI
. Configure all the nodes in the ThoughtSpot cluster:
    - Format and create export partitions, if they do not exist
    - Format the data disks

[#prepare_disks]
== Prepare disks
After the Ansible Playbook finishes, run the `prepare_disks` script on every node. You *must* run this script with elevated privileges, either with <<sudo,sudo>> or as a <<root,root user>>. Specify the data drives by adding the full device path for all data drives, such as `/dev/sdc`, after the script name. Separate data drives with a space.

Run the `prepare_disks` script, either with sudo or as a root user:

[#sudo]
=== Run prepare_disks with sudo

. Switch to the admin user:
+
[source]
----
su admin
----

. Run the prepare_disks script.
+
[source]
----
sudo /usr/local/scaligent/bin/prepare_disks.sh /dev/sdc /dev/sdd
----

[#root]
=== Run prepare_disks as a root user

. Run the prepare_disks script.
+
[source]
----
sudo su
/usr/local/scaligent/bin/prepare_disks.sh --username <admin user> /dev/sdc /dev/sdd
----

[#install-thoughtspot]
== Install the ThoughtSpot cluster and the application

Refer to the ThoughtSpot documentation for the detailed steps to install the ThoughtSpot cluster for each deployment platform:

- [*_RHEL only_*] xref:hardware-appliance.adoc[Hardware appliance]
