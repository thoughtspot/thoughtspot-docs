You can download your search as either a table or chart.

You have the option to download your table as a CSV (comma separated values), PDF, or XLSX (Excel) file. When you download a chart, it will be a PNG file.

* To download your search, click the *More* icon image:icon-more-10px.png[], and do any of the following:
 ** For a table, choose *Download as CSV*, *Download as PDF*, or *Download as XLSX*.
