:description: You can save and share R analyses as answers and Liveboards.


You can save and share R analyses as answers and Liveboards.

In terms of sharing, the R visualization you get as a result of running a script is similar to any other search result in ThoughtSpot.
You can save it, share it, and add it to Liveboards.

NOTE: We support R only in Falcon deployments (data imported into ThoughtSpot), and R integration is disabled by default. It is not available when creating xref:connections.adoc[connections] and linking to external databases in real time.
