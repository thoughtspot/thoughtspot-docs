A candlestick chart describes price movements of financial instruments, such as stocks, derivatives, currencies, and commodities.

Candlestick charts enable fast decision-making in stock, foreign exchange, commodity, and option trading because they describe price movements over time in terms of OHLC measurements: _open_, _high_, _low_, and _close_ prices. Each "candlestick" shows data for one day, so a monthly chart shows approximately 20 candlesticks, one for each trading day. The date is on the horizontal (X) axis, and it accounts for non-trading days. This chart type can accommodate intervals shorter or longer than one day, provided each interval clearly identifies the four measurements.

== How candlestick charts represent data

Candlestick charts have a very specific approach to representing data:

image::candlestick_components.png[Components of a Candlestick chart,float="right",role="right"]

* The _High_ and _Low_ values plot at the top and bottom of the candlestick.

* The _Open_ and _Close_ positions vary, depending on the relative values of the price at opening and closing of the trading day.

* The height of the rectangle depends on the difference between the _Open_ and _Close_ prices, and does not indicate the volume of trades.

* The 'wick' that extends upwards from the rectangle indicates the difference between the highest of _Open_ or _Close_, and highest traded value (_High_). Similarly for the extension downwards from the lowest of _Open_ or _Close_, and the lowest traded value (_Low_).

* Your search must compute four measures. Additionally, it must have a "for each" specification for the horizontal axis. Most commonly, this is a a periodicity, such as `daily`.

The search question can be expressed in the following form:

[source]
----
open high low close daily
----

* The candlestick chart does not show the volume of trades. However, the longer body of the candle generally correlates with the intensity of trading.

* When the rectangle is green and high relative to other time periods, this is an indicator that the market for the financial instrument is very bullish, with a likely "buy" recommendation.

* Alternatively, the red rectangles mean that the price is decreasing, and this pattern over time describes a bearish "sell" market for the instrument.

== Interpreting candlestick charts

The following excerpt shows candlestick data for only three dates, June 26 - 28, 2019.

[width="100%",options="header"]
|===
| Date | Open | High | Low | Close
| 06-26-2019 | $15.30 | $16.00 | $15.90 | $15.90
| 06-27-2019 | $15.60 | $15.80 | $15.70 | $15.70
| 06-28-2019 | $15.80 | $15.90 | $15.80 | $15.80
|===

Notice the following features of this chart:

* For both June 26th and 27th, the _Close_ price is higher than the _Open_ price. The candlesticks for these days are rendered in green.
* The close is lower than the open on June 28th, so the candlestick is red.
* June 26th has the highest difference between its _Open_ and _Close_ prices. You can easily determine this based on the height of the rectangle.
* The top-to-bottom size of the wicks vary with the _High_ and _Low_ prices. The range of prices in individual trades is greatest on June 26th, at $0.80. The range is identical, at $0.40, for both June 27th and June 28th.
* The _Open_ for one day almost never coincides with the _Close_ of the previous day. This is due to after-hours trading.


== Color customization in candlestick charts

image::candlestick_color.png[Color customization in candlestick chart,float="right",role="right"]
There are two color choices for this chart type:

- Up Color
- Down Color

ThoughtSpot uses Green and Red, respectively, as default.

Each candlestick renders in one of the two options, depending on the relative values of `open` and `close` measurements.

== Adapting candlestick charts for other data

You can use this chart to display other statistical data, as long as you provide four measurements in addition to specifying the horizontal axis.
