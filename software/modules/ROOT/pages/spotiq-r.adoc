Learn about R customizations.

Admins and users with the *Has SpotIQ* privilege can run an R script.

The R language is an open source programming language used for statistical computing.
As such, knowledgable users can use R to perform sophisticated analysis in a ThoughtSpot environment.

This section explains the feature and how to use it.
It is not meant as an R primer.
To learn more about R and how to use it, visit the https://www.r-project.org/[R Project for Statistical Computing^].

== Understand R script requirements in ThoughtSpot

ThoughtSpot provides R running as a service within a ThoughtSpot cluster.
Permissions are restricted.
This means the R script does not have permission to issue system commands.

The ThoughtSpot cluster has pre-installed the basic R packages.
If your script requires a specific package, you must request your ThoughtSpot cluster admin to install the package on your behalf.

ThoughtSpot internally transforms and binds an R script prior to sending it to the cluster's R service.
The system expects each script to have a well-defined structure, following this format:

----
####R SCRIPT####
<Fill script body>
####COLUMN BINDINGS (ONE PER LINE)####
<Fill column bindings here>
----

The scripts contains the column bindings with the answer results appearing as parameters in the R script.
For each `.param` _n_ in R your script, you must provide a corresponding binding.
The following pseudo code illustrates an R script in a form suitable for ThoughtSpot:

----
####R SCRIPT####
df <- data.frame(.param0,.param1, ...);
...
write.csv(..., file=#output_file#, ...);
----

Notice that `.param0` refers to first column in column binding and `.param1` refers to the second.
Should you need a third binding, you would use  `.param2` and so forth.

The output of the script is either PNG or CSV.
This example script uses `\#output_csv#` to emit data in a CSV (tabular) format.
Use `\#output_png#` to emit data in PNG format.

Presently, error reporting is limited for R scripts in SpotIQ.
You should validate your R script independent of your ThoughtSpot environment.
After you are sure it is free of syntax or other errors, you can try the script in ThoughtSpot.

== Try a Custom Analysis with R

This example illustrates how to run an R analysis on data that has a sales column and a zip code column.

. Sign in to ThoughtSpot and go to the *Search* bar.
. Use *Choose Sources* to locate a source with sales and zip code data.
This example uses *Sporting Goods Retail Worksheet* data.
. Enter `sales store zip code` in the search bar.
+
If your source contains the proper data, you should see something similar to the following:
+
image::spotiq-r1.png[]

. Click the *View R analysis* icon image:r-icon-inline-2.png[View R Analysis icon].
. Enter this sample script in the field.
+
----
 ####R SCRIPT####
 library(ggplot2)
 set.seed(20)
 df <- data.frame(.param0, .param1)
 cluster <- kmeans(df[1:2], 3, nstart = 20)
 cluster$cluster <- as.factor(cluster$cluster)
 png(file=#output_file#,width=400,height=350,res=72)
 print(ggplot(df, aes(.param0, .param1, color = cluster$cluster)) + geom_point())
----
+
This script binds `.param0` to `Sales` and `.param1` to the `Store Zip Code`  column.
+
You can see from the script that the output should be PNG  (`\#output_png#`).

. For Select column(s) for R analysis, make sure that both *Sales* and *Store Zip Code* columns are selected.
. For Output Filetype, make sure *PNG* is selected as the output format.
. Click *Run Analysis*.
+
SpotIQ runs your analysis in the background.

. When the analysis is completed, you should see the results in PNG format similar to the following:
+
image::spotiq-r6.png[]

You can run another R script directly on this result to get CSV results.
Try this on your own.
Here is the script to give you CSV output:

----
###R SCRIPT####
set.seed(20);
df <- data.frame(.param0,.param1);
cluster <- kmeans(df[1:2], 3, nstart = 20);
df$Cluster <- as.factor(cluster$cluster);
colnames(df)[1] <- 'Sales';
colnames(df)[2] <- 'Zip Code';
write.csv(df, file=#output_file#, row.names=FALSE);
----
