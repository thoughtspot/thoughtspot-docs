Learn how to back up or restore your ThoughtSpot cluster hosted in GCP using a GCS bucket.

It is recommended to use a bucket in the same region as your cluster.
By doing this, you avoid additional cross-region data transfer costs.

NOTE: you can only back up your cluster to a GCS bucket if it is a GCS-based cluster You cannot back up an HDFS-based cluster to a GCS bucket.
