When you perform a search or view and edit an Answer, you can rename the axes on your chart or the columns on your table.
To rename columns in an underlying worksheet, so that these names persist for any user searching on a worksheet, see xref:worksheets.adoc[create and use worksheets].

== Rename a chart axis

You can always rename a chart axis for clarity, brevity, format, and so on.

In the example below, it makes sense to rename the axis created from grouping as _Item Price & Item Cost_ to something shorter, like _Item Price and Cost_.

To rename an axis, follow these steps.

. While viewing your answer as a chart, click the dropdown menu icon image:icon-caret-right-20px.png[] next to the axis label you want to rename.
. Click *Rename*.

. Type the new name in the text box that appears, and either click out or hit *Enter/Return* on your keyboard.

== Rename a table column

You can rename a table column, or a pivot table column, in a similar way.

To rename a table or pivot table column, follow these steps.

. While viewing your answer as a table, click the more options menu icon image:icon-more-10px.png[] that appears when you hover over a column name.
. Click *Rename*.
