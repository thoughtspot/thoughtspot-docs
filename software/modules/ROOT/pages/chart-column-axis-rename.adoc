When you perform a search or view and edit an answer, you can rename the axes on your chart or the columns on your table.
To rename columns in an underlying worksheet, so that these names persist for any user searching on a worksheet, see xref:worksheets.adoc[create and use worksheets].

== Rename a chart axis

You can always rename a chart axis for clarity, brevity, format, and so on.

In the following example, it makes sense to rename the axis created from grouping as _Item Price & Item Cost_ to something shorter, like _Item Price and Cost_.

To rename an axis, follow these steps.

. While viewing your answer as a chart, select the dropdown menu icon image:icon-caret-right-20px.png[Dropdown menu icon image] next to the axis label you want to rename.
. Select *Rename*.

. Type the new name in the text box that appears, and either click out or select *Enter/Return* on your keyboard.

== Rename a table column

You can rename a table column, or a pivot table column, in a similar way.

To rename a table or pivot table column, follow these steps.

. While viewing your answer as a table, select the *more options* menu icon image:icon-more-10px.png[more options menu icon] that appears when you hover over a column name.
. Select *Rename*.

. Type the new name in the text box that appears, and either click out or select *Enter/Return* on your keyboard. The new name will be reflected in the table header, tooltips, legend, and chart configuration menu. Changes made to a table are not reflected in the underlying Worksheet.

Alternatively, you can select the chart configuration icon image:icon-gear-10px.png[chart configuration icon], select the tile for the column name, enter the new name in the text box, and click *Enter*.
