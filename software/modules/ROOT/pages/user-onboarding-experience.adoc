ThoughtSpot's onboarding is quick and intuitive; you can learn to use the application very quickly and efficiently.

When you begin using ThoughtSpot, the onboarding process starts automatically and guides you through a few basic scenarios.

Usually, you receive an email welcoming you to the onboarding process at ThoughtSpot.

To repeat user onboarding, see xref:user-profile.adoc#onboarding[Revisit onboarding].

Your onboarding experience begins when you login for the first time.
