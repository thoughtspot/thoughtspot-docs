// NOTE: the following commands have been REMOVED because their related features were deprecated (but the commands are still present in tscli: etl, cluster setup-release-host, cluster setup-release-host-key

The ThoughtSpot command line interface, or tscli, is an administration interface for the cluster. Use `tscli` to take snapshots (backups) of data, to apply updates, to stop and to start services, and to view information about the system. This reference defines each subcommand.

The command returns `0` code on success, and a non-zero exit code on failure.
The `tscli` command logs errors to the `stderr` directory.

This section has the following content:

[#tscli-command-how-to]
== Using the tscli command

The `tscli` command has the following syntax:

....

tscli [-h]
      [--helpfull]
      [--verbose]
      [--noautoconfig]
      [--autoconfig]
      [--yes]
      [--cluster ]
      [--zoo ]
      {access,alert,ansible,backup,backup-policy,calendar,callhome,cassandra,cluster,command,config-mode,csp,dataflow,dr-mirror,event,feature,fileserver,firewall,hdfs,ipsec,ldap,logs,map-tiles,monitoring,nas,nitro-switch,node,notification,onboarding,patch,rpackage,saml,scheduled-pinboards,set,smtp,snapshot,snapshot-policy,socialproof,ssl,sssd,storage,support,tokenauthentication,update}
....

The `tscli` command has several subcommands, such as `alert`, `backup`, and so on.

Issue subcommands using the following format:

----
tscli [subcommand]
----

Subcommands have their own additional options and actions, such as `tscli backup create` or `tscli backup delete`.

Each subcommand may have several options.
When a subcommand option is of the form `tscli subcommand --flag FLAG`, it requires a specific input from the user.
For example, the command `tscli access list --type TYPE`, where you want a list of pinboards, takes the form `tscli access list type pinboard`.

To view help for a subcommand, type `-h` after the subcommand option:

----
tscli [subcommand] -h
----

[#tscli-optional-flags]

  --cmd CMD;; Unix-Command to run on the selected logs. Use single quotes to escape spaces and other common characters. Note the language used to specify CMDSTR has the following rules:

    * A logfile and its corresponding result file can be referred to by the keywords `SRCFILE` and `DSTFILE`. For example, `cp SRCFILE DSTFILE`.
    * Without any reference to `DSTFILE` in CMDSTR, `DSTFILE` will be appended to CMDSTR for output redirection. For example, `du -sch SRCFILE` gets auto-translated to `du -sch SRCFILE > DSTFILE`.
    * Without any reference to `SRCFILE`, the contents of the log are streamed to CMDSTR by pipe. For example, `tail -n100 | grep ERROR` gets auto-translated to `cat SRCFILE | tail -n100 |     grep ERROR > DSTFILE`.
  --include INCLUDE;; Comma-separated list of logs to include. Each entry is either a "selector" or a glob for matching files. Selectors must be one of `all`, `orion`, `system`, or `ts`.

  --cmd_infmt CMD_INFMT;; Specify if the input file should be compressed or uncompressed before running `CMD`. Use `C` for compressed, and `U` for uncompressed. Don't use this flag if `CMD` works on both.
  --cmd_outfmt CMD_OUTFMT;; Specify if `OUTFILE` generated by `CMD` should be compressed or uncompressed. Use `C` for compressed, and `U` for uncompressed. Don't use this flag if output file is of the same format as the input file.

To use SSL, the following ports must be open:

* 443
* 80

Refer to xref:ssl.adoc[Configure SSL] for more information.

This subcommand has the following options:

tscli ssl add-valid-hosts [-h] VALID_HOSTS::
  Enables host validation for the specified host(s). Helps improve security. This feature is for all customers that have or are planning to enable SSL. Multiple hosts must be separated by a comma (,).

  * To ensure that the valid host is *cluster1.corp.example.com*, run the command `tscli ssl add-valid-hosts cluster1.corp.example.com`.
  * To allow all hosts that have the suffix *corp.example.com*, run the command `tscli ssl add-valid-hosts *.corp.example.com`. Use the wild card within the hostname.

[#tscli-storage]
=== storage

[source,tscli]
----
tscli storage [-h] {gc,df}
----

This subcommand has the following options:

tscli storage gc [-h] [--log_age LOG_AGE] [--force] [--localhost_only]::  Garbage collects unused storage.
+
Before issuing this command, you must stop the cluster using `tscli cluster stop`.
+
After garbage collection finishes, you can restart the cluster with `tscli cluster start`.
+
This command frees space in the following directories:
+
 /tmp
     /usr/local/scaligent/logs/
     /export/logs/orion
     /export/logs/oreo
     /export/logs/hadoop
     /export/logs/zookeeper
     cores
+
The `storage gc` subcommand accepts these optional flags:

  --force;; Forces deletion of all logs and temporary files regardless of age. Only run this command on a stopped cluster. To stop a cluster, run `tscli cluster stop`. The default setting is `False`.
  --localhost_only;; Only removes the logs on the local host. If not specified, the command acts on the entire cluster. The default is `False`.

This subcommand has the following options:

tscli support bundle [-h] [--include INCLUDE] [--exclude EXCLUDE] [--list_selectors] [--since SINCE] [--from FROM] [--to TO] [--out OUT] [--nodes NODES]::
  This subcommand specifies the support bundle. It uses the following flags:
  --include INCLUDE;; Comma-separated list of selectors to include. Each entry is either a "selector" or a glob for matching files. To see the list of valid selectors, run this command with `--list_selectors`. You may also specify `all` to get all selectors and logs, and `basic` to get only the basic selectors. Selectors can be used for logs collection: `all`, `orion`, `system`, `ts`, or the name of a service. Anything that starts with `/` (forward slash) is assumed to be a glob pattern, and is interpreted through `find(1)`. Other entries are ignored. Use single quotes around the parameter value to prevent undesired glob expansion. Use `all` to collect all selectors and all logs. The default setting is `all_but_logs`.
  --exclude EXCLUDE;; Comma-separated list of selectors to exclude. Applies to the list selected by `--include`. Parameters are interpreted in the same manner as in `--include`. Use the special keyword `logs` to exclude logs collection altogether. There is no default setting.
  --list_selectors;; Lists the selectors available for `--include` and `--exclude`, and then exits. The default setting is `False`.
  --since SINCE;; Grabs logs from the specified time window. Should be a human-readable duration string, such as `4h` (4 hours), `30m` (30 minutes), `1d` (1 day). There is no default setting.
  --from FROM;; Timestamp when collection begins. Must be of the form: `yyyymmdd-HH:MM`. There is no default setting.
  --to TO;; Timestamp when collection ends. Must be of the form: `yyyymmdd-HH:MM`. There is no default setting.
  --out OUT;; Tarball path for dumping the support bundle. The default setting is `/tmp/support_bundle.tar.gz`.
