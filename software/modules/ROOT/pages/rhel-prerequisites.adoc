[#set-up-hosts]
== Set up hosts for the ThoughtSpot cluster

Set up hosts for the ThoughtSpot cluster on your chosen platform.
Please refer to the relevant deployment sections in our documentation for the exact specification for the hosts: CPU, memory, and disks.

* ThoughtSpot-certified hardware appliance manufactured by xref:dell.adoc[DELL]
* ThoughtSpot-certified hardware appliance manufactured by xref:smc.adoc[SMC]
* xref:aws-configuration-options.adoc[Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2]
* xref:gcp-configuration-options.adoc[Google Cloud Platform (GCP)]
* xref:azure-configuration-options.adoc[Microsoft Azure]
* xref:vmware.adoc[VMware]

[#partition-hosts]
== Partition the hosts

Ensure that all ThoughtSpot hosts meet the following partition and sizing requirements.
All drives must be SSDs.

Do not partition the data drives. ThoughtSpot partitions the data drives during installation. For information about data drive specifications, refer to the intro articles for each platform linked in the <<set-up-hosts,set up hosts>> section of this article.

[cols="15,85",options="header"]
|===
| Path | Required free space

| /
| 20 GB. This is the root drive.

| /tmp
| 50 GB

| /export
| 200 GB, on a separate filesystem
|===

NOTE: For ThoughtSpot-certified hardware platforms, xref:dell.adoc[Dell] and xref:smc.adoc[Super Micro Computer], you must use a secondary drive rather than a partition, because the root drive has a limit of 200 GB. This drive must be separate from the data drive(s).

[#install-rhel]
== Install RHEL on hosts

ThoughtSpot is certified with RHEL versions 7.8 and 7.9;
we *do not* support other versions of RHEL, including 7.7, 8, and 8.1.
Install RHEL version 7.8 or 7.9. On RHEL version 7.8, ensure that your xref:linux-kernel-version[linux kernel version] is 3.10.0-1127.19.1 or higher. On RHEL version 7.9, use the default linux kernel.

NOTE: When installing ThoughtSpot on online clusters, the Ansible playbook upgrades the OS to RHEL 7.9. The Ansible playbook does *not* upgrade the OS when installing offline.

[#linux-kernel-version]
=== Linux kernel version

For RHEL version 7.8, your Linux kernel *_must_* be on version 3.10.0-1127.19.1 or higher.
RHEL 7.8 used to come with a Linux kernel of version 3.10.x, which has a bug that causes nodes to reboot unexpectedly.
The default Linux kernel version for RHEL 7.8 is now 3.10.0-1127.19.1.
However, you may have an older RHEL 7.8, with a Linux kernel of version 3.10.x.
You must upgrade to 3.10.0-1127.19.1 or higher.
If you have trouble upgrading your Linux kernel to version 3.10.0-1127.19.1 or higher, contact xref:support-contact.adoc[ThoughtSpot Support].
This is a requirement for *all* platforms: hardware appliance, cloud, and VMware.

If you are using RHEL version 7.9, use the default Linux kernel.

WARNING: If you are running RHEL 7.8, and your Linux kernel version is not 3.10.0-1127.19.1 or higher, you may run into unexpected node reboots and possible loss of data.

[#enable-hosts]
== Enable the hosts to download RHEL packages

*Repositories*

[#yum-repository]
Yum repositories::
  You must enable the following Yum repositories in your cluster: +
  6.3 and earlier;; `epel`, `nux-desktop`, `pgdg95`, `rhel`, `rhel-optional`, `rhel-extras`.
  6.3.1 and later;; `epel`, `pgdg95`, `pgdg11`, `rhel`, `rhel-optional`, `rhel-extras`.

[#python-repository]
Python repository::
  For Python, ensure the machine is able to reach the `PyPI` repository located at https://pypi.python.org/.

[#r-repository]
R repository::
  For R, ensure the machine is able to reach the `CRAN` repository located at https://cran.rstudio.com/.

Make sure that you can download RHEL packages to all hosts, either from the xref:official-repositories[official package repositories], or from a xref:mirror-repositories[mirror repository] owned and managed by your organization.

If you cannot access the RHEL repositories, there is no mirror repository in your organization, or you are unable to access Yum, Python, or R repositories, contact xref:support-contact.adoc[ThoughtSpot Support^].

[#official-repositories]
*Official package repositories*

If the hosts of your ThoughtSpot cluster can access external repositories, either directly or through a proxy, your cluster is online.
You can then proceed to download xref:yum-repository[Yum], xref:python-repository[Python], and xref:r-repository[R] package repositories.

[#mirror-repositories]
*Internal mirror repository*

If the hosts of your ThoughtSpot cluster have access to an internal repository that mirrors the public repositories, copy the xref:yum-repository[Yum], xref:python-repository[Python], and xref:r-repository[R] package repositories to your hosts.

[#disable-selinux]
== Disable SELinux or run it in permissive mode

ThoughtSpot does not support policies that enforce SELinux.
We recommend that you disable SELinux, or run it in permissive mode.

[#tmp-permission]
== Ensure tmp has permission 777

The `/tmp` directory must have the `777` permission. If you mount the `/tmp` directory as a separate partition, it must NOT have the `noexec` flag set.

[#proc]
== Ensure /proc mount point flags are compatible

You cannot mount the /proc mount point with the `hidepid` flag. You must mount it without that flag.

[#etc-sudoers]
== Remove Defaults requiretty from /etc/sudoers

The `/etc/sudoers` file must not have the `Defaults requiretty` line. This line can cause cluster creation to fail.

[#enable-ansible]
== [Optional] Enable an Ansible Control Server

Optionally configure an Ansible Control Server, on a separate host, to run the Ansible playbook that ThoughtSpot supplies.
You must install both `rsync` and Ansible on the Ansible Control Server host.
