Learn how to install and set up ThoughtSpot's mobile app.

Before you install the mobile app, ask your ThoughtSpot administrator where you should get it, and which method of VPN (if any) you should use to access your ThoughtSpot cluster.

== Set up VPN

Ask your ThoughtSpot administrator, which of the following methods you should use to securely sign in to  the app and access your ThoughtSpot cluster:

=== Per-app VPN [Recommended]

If you download the app from your company's internal app store (mobile device management platform), you can sign in using the powerful and secure Per-APP VPN feature provided by your platform.
Ask your administrator which platform your company uses, and then use one of the following resources to configure the VPN options:

=== Standard VPN

If you download the app from the App Store for iOS or Google Play for Android, you can use standard VPN to sign in.

* Open the VPN app on your iOS/Android device and authenticate.

== Install the app

Contact your ThoughtSpot administrator, to determine where to get the app.

=== App Store or Google Play

If your company allows you to download it from the App Store for iOS or Google Play, download it from here:
