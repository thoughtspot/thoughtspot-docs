:description: Use ThoughtSpot Modeling Language (TML) to model or update answers in a flat-file format.


include::partial$liveboards-announcement.adoc[]

Use ThoughtSpot Modeling Language to model or update answers in a flat-file format. You can migrate the object to a different cluster, or restore it to the same cluster.

To work with scriptable answers in ThoughtSpot, download these objects to a flat file in `TML` format, modify it, and subsequently upload this file either to the same cluster, or to a different cluster.
To learn how to export, change, and update answers, see xref:scriptability.adoc[Scriptability].
