= Enable Columns for SearchIQ
:last_updated: 11/19/2019

Allow users to use SearchIQ by enabling SearchIQ for the columns of the data source.

SearchIQ is in [.label.label-beta]#Beta#.

NOTE: SearchIQ is turned off by default.
ThoughtSpot Support can enable it for you.
SearchIQ is only available in English.

Before enabling columns, keep in mind these points, and other in-product guidelines:

* Enable no more than fifteen (15) columns for SearchIQ.
* Enable at most one (1) date column.
* Column names should not contain more than 3 words.
* Name the columns well, by optimizing for business users.
For example, use _Opportunity Cost_ and avoid `opp_cst`.
* Avoid indexing descriptive columns, ones that contain more than seven (7) words, or contain values with stop words, such as _is_, _are_, _the_, _what_, and so on).
See the xref:stop-words.adoc[Stop Words] reference for the full list of stop words.
* For columns that represent formulas with categorical values, set the *Indexing Type* to `PREFIX_AND_SUBSTRING`.

. Change the *Entity Category* for the columns you marked *SearchIQ Enabled*, from _default_ to one that accurately describes the column.
+
See xref:set-entity-category.adoc[Set Entity Categories].
The category options are _default_, _person_, _replace_, _time_, _money_, _product_, _zip_code_, _lat_long_, _company_org_, and _num_types_.

. Add *Synonyms* for all columns you marked *SearchIQ Enabled*, simply by typing them in the appropriate cell.
See xref:change-visibility-synonym.adoc[Add common synonyms] for more information.

. Change the *Index Type* to `DONT_INDEX` for columns when they must be excluded from indexing.
We recommend excluding a column when it is descriptive in nature, =contains a large amount of text, has xref:stop-words.adoc[stop words], or for a variety of similar reason.
See xref:change-index.adoc[Turn off indexing].

+
This prevents SearchIQ from scanning through large amounts of text to understand what user asked.
Note that searches on text fields that use the `contains` keyword still work.

. Change the *Index Type* for columns that represent formulas with categorical values to `PREFIX_AND_SUBSTRING`.
See xref:change-index.adoc[Turn off indexing].
