== Deployment options

There are two options for your users to download the ThoughtSpot mobile app:

* Your MDM platform

=== App Store for iOS or Google Play for Android

The ThoughtSpot app is available from the App Store and Google Play.
Your users can download it directly from there.

There are two ways to provide the ThoughtSpot app to your users with your MDM platform:

==== Option 1 [Recommended]: Provide a link to the App Store or Google Play.
