= How to improve throughput
:last_updated: tbd

Adjusting the transaction size may correct poor performance and low throughput.

The transaction/commit size value can improve the throughput of the load when setting up the ODBC Driver.

Adjusting the transaction size may correct poor performance and low throughput issues.
The transaction size should be set to match the total number of rows that are expected to be loaded in the load cycle.
However, increasing this value even higher should help improve throughput of the load.

WARNING: high transaction size may slow down the ThoughtSpot system.

This is where the transaction size field exists for SSIS.
Clicking on the ODBC destination reveals the properties on the right hand side, where the *Transaction Size* can be found.

See xref:set-up-the-odbc-driver-using-ssis.adoc[Set up the ODBC Driver for SSIS] for more details on setting the transaction size.
