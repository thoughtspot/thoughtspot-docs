This article explains how to set up High Availability (HA) for your ThoughtSpot cluster using the AWS Elastic File System (EFS).

[#configure-ha]
== Configure high availability

Follow these steps to set up High Availability (HA) for your ThoughtSpot cluster using the AWS Elastic File System (EFS).

. Create an EFS File System that spans across different availability zones, and across different subnets.
+
Refer to AWS documentation on https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/getting-started.html?shortFooter=true[creating an EFS File System^].
. Create two ThoughtSpot clusters in each availability zone and in the subnets, where the new file system is.
. Change the IP addresses of the cluster, if necessary.
. Create an EFS `<customizable_name>` directory in the `/home/admin` path.
. Issue the following command to mount the new file system.
+
Modify the fields as necessary for your installation.
+
[source]
----
sudo mount -t nfs -o nfsvers=4.1,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,hard,timeo=600,retrans=2,
                     noresvport fs-f756f1ee.efs.us-west-1.amazonaws.com:/ /home/admin/efs/
----

. Modify permissions to ensure that all clusters with EFS mount points have read and write permissions.
+
[source]
----
chmod 777 /home/admin/efs
----

. On the first cluster, create a snapshot on to the EFS mount point, and back it up.
+
[source]
----
tscli snapshot create EfsTest HA 2
----

. Create a backup on the cluster.
+
[source]
----
tscli backup create --mode full --type full
                    --storage_type local EfsTest /home/admin/efs/Efs-backup
----

. Ensure that the backup is successful, and that it can be accessed from all clusters where EFS is mounted, by listing all backups and looking for the new one.
+
[source]
----
  tscli backup ls
----

. Take down the first cluster instances.
. On the second cluster, delete the existing cluster.
. Create a new cluster by restoring from the first cluster backup.
+
This is accessible from the EFS mount point.
+
[source]
----
tscli cluster restore /home/admin/EFS/Efs-backup
----

Your cluster is now successfully restored to the second cluster from the backup on the EFS, achieving HA for ThoughtSpot clusters.

[#replace-cluster]
== Replace a cluster

For information on how to recover from infrastructure failure scenarios, see xref:cluster-replacement.adoc[Cluster replacement].

NOTE: At this time, ThoughtSpot does not support AWS Auto Scaling or deployment across AWS availability zones or regions.
