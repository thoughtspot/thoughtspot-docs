You can adjust the data model for a newly loaded table.

To make modeling settings for a data source you've just loaded, or to make a quick change to existing settings, use the ThoughtSpot web interface.
You can adjust the *Columns* settings from the data management listing.

You can change all the same data model settings here as in the model file.
This method is easier and faster, unless you need to make many settings in bulk.
In that case, xref:data-modeling-edit.adoc[using the model file] is recommended.
