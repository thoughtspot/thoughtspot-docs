Learn about the system worksheets that ThoughtSpot provides.

Most of the monitoring information in *System Health* comes from system worksheets and views which administrators can view, but not modify.
The underlying tables are protected system tables that cannot be accessed directly.
However, administrators can create new, custom monitoring reports from the worksheets and views.

To list the system worksheets and views:

. Go to the *Data* tab.
. Choose *All* and *All types*.
. Enter `System User` in the search field.
