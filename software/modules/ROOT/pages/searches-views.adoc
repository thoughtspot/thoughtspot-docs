If you want to search on top of another search, try saving your search as a view. Then, you can use the saved view as a data source for a new search.

include::partial$liveboards-announcement.adoc[]

This procedure walks you through creating a view from a search. To learn how to create a SQL view, see xref:sql-views.adoc[SQL views].

To create a view from a search:

. Start a new search, or edit an existing Answer, or visualization from a Liveboard.
+
Any filters or aggregations created during this search become part of the new view.

. Make any changes to the visualization that you want in your saved view (change aggregation level, filters, and so on)
. Click the *More* menu  image:icon-more-10px.png[more options menu icon] (ellipses icon), and select *Create view*.

. xref:relationship-create.adoc[Link] your view to any other data source, or xref:constraints.adoc[define joins].

Your view is now saved.
You may want to xref:views-materialized.adoc[materialize the view] to improve its performance when searching.
