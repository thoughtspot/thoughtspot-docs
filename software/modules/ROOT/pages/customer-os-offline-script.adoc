:description: If you are deploying ThoughtSpot offline, you must run the run-offline.sh script before you can configure and run the ansible playbook.

After you untar the ansible tarball, but before you configure and run the ansible playbook, you must run the `run_offline.sh` script on your local machine. This is *_only_* required for offline deployments of ThoughtSpot on your own OS. This script is not available if you are deploying online.

The `run_offline.sh` script installs the required xref:customer-os-packages.adoc[Yum, Python, and R packages] without connecting to the internet.

Run the run_offline.sh script on all nodes, including the <<flags,optional flags>> as necessary. Run this command as either a <<root,root user>> or <<sudo,with sudo>>.

[#root]
== Run run_offline as a root user

Run the following command as a root user, including the <<flags,optional flags>> as necessary.

[source,bash]
----
run_offline.sh
----

[#sudo]
== Run run_offline with sudo

Run the following command, including the <<flags,optional flags>> as necessary. Run this command as a non-root user with sudo permissions.

[source,bash]
----
sudo run_offline.sh
----

[#flags]
== Optional flags

`run_offline.sh` has the following optional flags:

-r:: Skips installing R packages. This can make the installation quicker. If you specify this flag in the `run_offline.sh` script, you must also set xref:customer-os-ansible-configure.adoc#skip_r[the skip_r flag in the ansible playbook].

-s:: Skips installing ansible. If you already have ansible installed, or if you run ansible on a different node separate from the ThoughtSpot installation, include this flag when you run `run_offline.sh`. This skips the ansible yum package installation on the node.

-v::
Verbose output.

-y:: Skips installing yum packages. *_Only_* use this flag if you are sure you already have all the required yum packages already installed.



== Next steps

Next, xref:customer-os-ansible-configure.adoc[configure and run the ansible playbook].
