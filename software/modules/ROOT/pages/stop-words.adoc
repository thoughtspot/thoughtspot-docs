ThoughtSpot recognizes a defined list of 'helper' words; we call them stop words.

This reference lists the various stop words that ThoughtSpot recognizes as normal parts of the language (articles, prepositions, conjunctions, and interjections).

When setting up sample searches for your organization, we recommend that these questions contain only the following:

* Exact column names or their synonyms
* Exact values (for filtering)
* Keywords
* Stop words
