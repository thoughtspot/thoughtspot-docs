Learn how to materialize a view to improve its performance.

To improve the performance of a view, you can materialize it.
This operation computes the data for the view and stores it in memory, just like a table.
You can expect a 3-6 times performance improvement on a materialized view over a view that is not materialized.
However, materialized views take up space in memory, so weigh the tradeoffs and benefits of materializing a view ahead of time.

NOTE: Row Level Security does not apply to materialized views.
All users will see the same data when using the materialized view as a data source.

To materialize a view:

include::partial$view-materialize-navigation.adoc[]

. If you don't have any joins, you may wish to add them now.
See xref:relationship-create.adoc[add joins].
. Under *Materialization*, click *Materialize*.

. Fill in the details for xref:constraints.adoc[primary key], xref:sharding.adoc[sharding key, and number of shards].
+

+
NOTE: If you do not fill in the sharding details, the view is replicated on every node of your cluster.
Follow the links in this step to learn more about sharding.

. Click *Materialize*.
. In the *Schedule data updates* dialog, decide if you want to configure the schedule to refresh materialized view at this time.
+
If you want to skip this step and perhaps schedule it later, click *Setup later*.

. You can see the status of the materialization in progresses.

. Click *Update status* to refresh materialization status.
. Note that when the materialization completes, the status changes to *Materialized*.

+
If after some time, the status has not changed to *Materialized*, check the xref:views-materialized.adoc#materialization-status[list of statuses] and corresponding actions to take.

When it says *Materialized* your materialized view is ready for search.
