As an analyst, you create and manage worksheets for everyone in your organization. Let us guide you through the necessary steps.

When you start using ThoughtSpot, you choose your persona based on how you use ThoughtSpot, either to search and analyze data, or to set up data connections and model business use case for your team.

When you select option two, you choose to act as an analyst.
In response, ThoughtSpot automatically starts the analyst onboarding process, taking you through the workflows to set up the system for yourself and other users. First, you watch a short video introduction to ThoughtSpot. Then, ThoughtSpot guides you through several sample searches with xref:search-assist.adoc[Search Assist]. Then, you enter the *Setup* process.

We recommend you watch our short introduction to the analyst workflows:

As an _analyst_, you primarily use ThoughtSpot in the following manner:

. Set up data connections;
see xref:connections.adoc[Connect data].
. Define relationships and create worksheets that help your team search and analyze data;
see xref:worksheet-create-setup.adoc[Create a worksheet automatically].
. Search data to create visualizations and analyze the results;
see xref:search-start.adoc[Search and visualize].

The analyst onboarding on the *Setup* page guides you through these main workflows.
During onboarding, you see the *Setup* tab on the top navigation bar.

As you complete these tasks, the progress bar at the bottom of your screen helps to guide you through the steps, and updates when you finish each step.
The progress bar appears everywhere in ThoughtSpot, except in the *Setup* page.
Select *Go to setup checklist* to the left of the progress bar to learn more about your next task, and click *finish setup* to exit.

. Select *Profile* from the user icon at the top right of the page.
. In the *Preferences* section, click *Revisit* to repeat new user onboarding.
