After careful consideration, ThoughtSpot has made the decision to discontinue ThoughtSpot Software, with sustaining support beginning on October 1, 2025 and the product reaching its End of Life and End of Support on July 1, 2027.

== What this means for you

We understand that ThoughtSpot Software (including ThoughtSpot Connections, Flex, and Falcon) plays a role in your operations, and we're committed to making this transition as smooth as possible.  We value your trust in us and want to assure you that our priority is to minimize disruption and provide the guidance you need. Here's what you can expect:

=== Full support period

From now until July 1, 2027 or the end of your current order-form term (whichever is earlier), you'll continue to receive our complete support, including technical assistance, bug fixes, and security updates.

=== Data Access
You retain full ownership of your data throughout this process. We recommend exporting your data well before the End of Life date to ensure a seamless transition.

If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to contact your account manager or {support-url}.
