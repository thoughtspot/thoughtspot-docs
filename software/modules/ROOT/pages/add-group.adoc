ThoughtSpot has intuitive and powerful user group management for assigning privileges, user selection, multi-tier subgroups, default Pinboard assignment, and emailing.

Before adding users, create the groups to which they belong.
Each group includes a set of privileges for its users.

[#add-group]
== Create a group

To create a group and add privileges for the group, follow these steps:

| Field | Description
a| [[group-name]]Group name | Enter a unique name for the group.
a| [[display-name]]Display name | Name of the group as it appears in ThoughtSpot.
a| [[sharing-visibility]]Sharing visibility | Indicate whether objects can be shared with this group. When set to *SHARABLE*, this group is an option in the *Share* dialog.
a| [[description]]Description | Optionally, enter a description.
a| [[privileges]]Privileges | Check the xref:about-users-groups.adoc#list-of-privileges[privileges] you want to grant to the group. If you add the privilege *Has administration privileges* to a group, all users in that group can see all the data in ThoughtSpot. Administrators can always see all data sources, and xref:about-row-security.adoc[Row level security] does not apply to them.
