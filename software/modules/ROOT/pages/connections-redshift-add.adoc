== Before you begin

If you are going to use SSL or OAuth, you must configure them before you can add a Redshift connection.

=== Enabling SSL in Amazon Redshift

If you need to create a secure connection to Amazon Redshift, you must edit the "parameter group" assigned to your Redshift cluster and enable the _require_SSL_ flag.

To enable *FIPS-compliant SSL* mode, set both the _use_fips_ssl_ parameter and the _require_SSL_ parameter to *true* in the parameter group that is associated with your Redshift cluster.

For more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/connecting-ssl-support.html[Connect using SSL^] in Amazon's Redshift documentation.

=== Configuring OAuth

If you need to use OAuth with Redshift, you must configure an OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider in AWS IAM. For details, see xref:connections-redshift-oauth.adoc[Configure OAuth for a Redshift connection].

== Adding a Redshift connection

To connect to Amazon Redshift:

. Click *Data* in the top navigation bar.
. Click the *Connections* tab at the top of the page, and click *+ Add connection* at the upper-right-hand side of the page.
. Create a name for your connection, a description (optional), then select the Redshift connection type, and click *Continue*.
+

. Enter the connection details for your Redshift data source using Service Account, IAM or OAuth. The *User* you specify must have at least *read* access to the *SVV_TABLE_INFO* table.
+

+
For Service Account authentication, do the following:

** Enter Host, Port, User, Password, and Database.

+
--
For IAM authentication, do the following:

** Enter Host, Port, Database, Db User, Access Key, and Secret Key.

+
--
For OAuth authentication, do the following:

 ** Enter Host, Port, Database, OAuth Client ID, OAuth Client Secret, Auth Url, Access token Url, Role ARN, and DbGroups.
+
Refer to the xref:connections-redshift-reference.adoc[Redshift connection reference] for more information on each of the specific attributes you must enter for your connection.

. (Optional) To customize additional JDBC parameters supported by Redshift, use *Advanced Config*. Refer to the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/jdbc20-configuration-options.html[Redshift JDBC documentation^].

. (Optional) If you enabled SSL in your Redshift cluster, you must do the following:
 .. Click the *Advanced Config* menu to reveal the *Key* and *Value* fields.
 .. For Key, enter *SSL*.
 .. For Value, enter *True*.

+
To add more keys and values, click the plus sign (+), and enter them.

+
NOTE: Any key-value pairs that you enter must be defined in your Redshift data source.
Key-value pairs are case-sensitive.
. Click *Continue*.
. Select tables (on the left) and the columns from each table (on the right), and then click *Create connection*.
+

+
Once the connection is added, you can search your Redshift database right away by clicking *Search now*.
+
image::redshift-connectioncreated.png[The "connection created" screen]
+
Your new connection appears on the *Data* > *Connections* page.
You can click the name of your connection to view the tables and columns in your connection.

The connection you just created is a link to the external data source.
If there are any joins in the selected tables of the external data source, those are imported into ThoughtSpot.

You can now perform a live query on the selected tables and columns of your connection.
Because the selected tables and columns in your connection are linked, it may take a while to initially render the search results.
This is because ThoughtSpot does not cache linked data.
With linked data, ThoughtSpot queries the external database directly.
