[#search]
== Search settings

Under *Search settings*, you can configure ThoughtSpot’s indexing behavior, and enable or disable summaries and headlines.

To learn more about ThoughtSpot's default indexing behavior, refer to xref:data-modeling-index.adoc[].

To manage search settings, follow these steps:

. Select the *Edit* button in the *Search Settings* section.

. *Index columns*: Click on the toggle to enable or disable ThoughtSpot’s indexing of columns in new connections. If you disable this feature, all columns from new connections are set to `DONT_INDEX`. Note that this change only applies to columns from _new_ connections. You must manually set columns that already exist to `INDEX` or `DONT_INDEX`.

. *Index frequency*: Select a frequency for column indexing from the dropdown. The options are 8, 16, or 24 hours. To further customize your indexing frequency and the index start time, contact {support-url}.

. *Summaries and headlines*: Click on the toggle to enable or disable the display of summaries in adhoc search. This setting only affects the display of summaries for users on the xref:answer-experience-new.adoc[new answer experience], not the classic experience.

NOTE: This setting does not affect the display of summaries in saved objects, such as saved answers, pinned tables, or headline tiles in Liveboards.

. Select *Save changes*. Alternatively, you can *Reset to default*. By default, ThoughtSpot indexes new columns at a frequency of 24 hours, and enables summaries and headlines.

[#spotiq]
== SpotIQ settings

Under *SpotIQ settings*, you can enable or disable xref:spotiq-custom.adoc[SpotIQ analyze].

To enable or disable SpotIQ Analyze, follow these steps:

. Select the *Edit* button in the *SpotIQ Settings* section.

. Click on the toggle to enable or disable the feature.

. Select *Save changes*. Alternatively, you can *Reset to default*. By default, SpotIQ Analyze is enabled.

[#experience]
== ThoughtSpot experience

Under *ThoughtSpot experience*, you can manage availability of the xref:answer-experience-new.adoc[new answer experience] and xref:spotiq.adoc[new SpotIQ experience] for all users.

There are two different toggles for each new experience in this section. The first toggle, *New [ answer | SpotIQ ] experience*, turns on the ability to opt into the new experience for any user. The second toggle, *Make new [ answer | SpotIQ ] experience default*, turns the new experience on by default.

You can turn the new answer and SpotIQ experiences on or off globally, and specify the default answer and SpotIQ experiences for all users.
For example, you can turn the new answer experience on globally and make it the default experience, and turn the new SpotIQ experience on globally, but keep the classic SpotIQ experience the default, allowing users to opt into the new SpotIQ experience.

NOTE: The new SpotIQ experience depends on the new answer experience. To enable the new SpotIQ experience, you must first enable the new answer experience.

To manage the new answer and SpotIQ experiences, follow these steps:

. Select the *Edit* button in the *ThoughtSpot Experiences* section.

. Enable or disable the new answer and/ or SpotIQ experiences.

. If you enable the new answer or SpotIQ experiences, you can specify whether they should be on by default for all users, or if they should have to opt in.
+
For example, to display the new answer experience to all users, enable the *new answer experience* toggle, then enable the *Make new answer experience default* toggle.
+
To display the classic answer experience to all users, but allow them to turn the new experience on for themselves in their profile, enable the *new answer experience* toggle, then disable the *Make new answer experience default* toggle.
. Select *Save*.

[#visualization-footer]
== Visualization footer settings

NOTE: The visualization footer feature is part of the xref:answer-experience-new.adoc[new answer experience], which is in Beta and off by default. You can turn it on xref:user-profile.adoc#new-answer-experience[from your profile]. If you are using the classic experience, you cannot set a standard download footer. The footer appears only in downloaded answers, *_not_* in downloaded Liveboards.

Specify the footer that appears in all downloaded answers. Use this functionality to add a confidentiality disclaimer, for example.

To edit the standard footer for downloaded answers, follow these steps:

. Select the *Edit* button in the *Visualization* section.

. Edit the text box next to *Downloaded file instructions* with the text you would like to appear in the footer, up to 700 characters.

The default footer is *Disclaimer: The information downloaded is confidential*.
