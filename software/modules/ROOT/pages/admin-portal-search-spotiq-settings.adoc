[#search]
== Search settings

Under *Search settings*, you can configure ThoughtSpot’s indexing behavior, and enable or disable summaries and headlines.

To learn more about ThoughtSpot's default indexing behavior, refer to xref:data-modeling-index.adoc[].

To manage search settings, follow these steps:

. Select the *Edit* button in the *Search Settings* section.

. *Index columns*: Click on the toggle to enable or disable ThoughtSpot’s indexing of columns in new connections. If you disable this feature, all columns from new connections are set to `DONT_INDEX`. Note that this change only applies to columns from _new_ connections. You must manually set columns that already exist to `INDEX` or `DONT_INDEX`.

. *Index frequency*: Select a frequency for column indexing from the dropdown. The options are 8, 16, or 24 hours. To further customize your indexing frequency and the index start time, contact {support-url}.

. *Summaries and headlines*: Click on the toggle to enable or disable the display of summaries in adhoc search. This setting only affects the display of summaries for users on the xref:answer-experience-new.adoc[new answer experience], not the classic experience.

[#visualization-footer]
== Visualization footer settings

NOTE: The visualization footer feature is part of the xref:answer-experience-new.adoc[new answer experience], which is in Beta and off by default. You can turn it on xref:user-profile.adoc#new-answer-experience[from your profile]. If you are using the classic experience, you cannot set a standard download footer. The footer appears only in downloaded answers, *_not_* in downloaded Liveboards.

Specify the footer that appears in all downloaded answers. Use this functionality to add a confidentiality disclaimer, for example.

To edit the standard footer for downloaded answers, follow these steps:

. Select the *Edit* button in the *Visualization* section.

. Edit the text box next to *Downloaded file instructions* with the text you would like to appear in the footer, up to 700 characters.

The default footer is *Disclaimer: The information downloaded is confidential*.
