[#search]
== Search settings

Under *Search settings*, you can configure ThoughtSpot’s indexing behavior, and enable or disable summaries and headlines.

To learn more about ThoughtSpot's default indexing behavior, refer to xref:data-modeling-index.adoc[].

To manage search settings, follow these steps:

. Select the *Edit* button in the *Search Settings* section.

. *Index columns*: Select the toggle to enable or disable ThoughtSpot’s indexing of columns in new connections. If you disable this feature, all columns from new connections are set to `DONT_INDEX`. Note that this change only applies to columns from _new_ connections. You must manually set columns that already exist to `INDEX` or `DONT_INDEX`.

. *Index frequency*: Select a frequency for column indexing from the dropdown. The options are 8, 16, or 24 hours. To further customize your indexing frequency and the index start time, contact {support-url}.

. *Summaries and headlines*: Select the toggle to enable or disable the display of summaries in ad hoc search. This setting only affects the display of summaries for users on the xref:answer-experience-new.adoc[new answer experience], not the classic experience.
+
NOTE: This setting does not affect the display of summaries in saved objects, such as saved answers, pinned tables, or headline tiles in Liveboards.

. Select *Save changes*. Alternatively, you can *Reset to default*. By default, ThoughtSpot indexes new columns at a frequency of 24 hours, and enables summaries and headlines.

[#spotiq]
== SpotIQ settings

Under *SpotIQ settings*, you can enable or disable xref:spotiq-custom.adoc[SpotIQ analyze].

To enable or disable SpotIQ Analyze, follow these steps:

. Select the *Edit* button in the *SpotIQ Settings* section.

. Select the toggle to enable or disable the feature.

. Select *Save changes*. Alternatively, you can *Reset to default*. By default, SpotIQ Analyze is enabled.

[#thoughtspot-experience]
== ThoughtSpot experience settings
Under *ThoughtSpot experience*, you can manage availability of the new xref:answer-experience-new.adoc[Answer], xref:liveboard-experience-new.adoc[Liveboard], and xref:spotiq-custom.adoc[SpotIQ] experiences for all users.

NOTE: The new Liveboard and SpotIQ experiences are dependent on the new Answer experience. To enable the new Liveboard or SpotIQ experience, ensure that you first enable the xref:answer-experience-new.adoc[new Answer experience].

There are two different toggles for each new experience in this section. The first toggle, *New [ Answer | SpotIQ | Liveboard ] experience*, turns on the ability to opt into the new experience for any user. The second toggle, *Make new [ Answer | SpotIQ | Liveboard ] experience default*, turns the new experience on by default.

You can turn the new Answer, SpotIQ, or Liveboard experience on or off globally, and specify the default experience for all users. For example, you can turn the new Liveboard experience on globally, but keep the classic experience the default, allowing users to opt into the new experience.

To manage the new experiences, follow these steps:

. Select the *Edit* button in the *ThoughtSpot experience* section.

. Select the relevant toggle to enable or disable the new experience[s].

. After you enable a new experience, you can specify whether it should be on by default for all users, or if they should have to opt in.
+
To display the new experience to all users, enable the *new [Answer | SpotIQ | Liveboard] experience* toggle, then enable the *Make new [Answer | SpotIQ | Liveboard] experience default* toggle.
+
To display the classic Answer, SpotIQ, or Liveboard, experience to all users, but allow them to turn the new experience on for themselves in their profile, enable the *new [Answer | SpotIQ | Liveboard] experience* toggle, then disable the corresponding *Make new [Answer | SpotIQ | Liveboard] experience default* toggle.

[#visualization-footer]
== Visualization footer settings

Specify the footer that appears in all downloaded answers and Liveboards. Use this functionality to add a confidentiality disclaimer, for example. You can also allow your users to add their own footers to downloaded Liveboards.

Note that this standard footer does not apply to Liveboards downloaded with the https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/?pageid=liveboard-export-api[Liveboard export API^]. Liveboards downloaded with the API use the footer specified by the `footer_text` API parameter.

To edit the standard footer, follow these steps:

To edit the standard footer for downloaded answers, follow these steps:

. Select the *Edit* button in the *Visualization* section.

. Edit the text box next to *Downloaded file instructions* with the text you would like to appear in the footer, up to 700 characters.
+
The default footer is *Disclaimer: The information downloaded is confidential*.
+
To allow your users to add their own footers to downloaded Liveboards, remove all content from the text box.

. Select *Save*.

=== Footer behavior

This footer replaces the *Footer text* option that appears when you xref:liveboard-download-pdf.adoc[download a Liveboard as a PDF]. Instead, if you are on the xref:liveboard-experience-new.adoc[new Liveboard experience], you see a note under the footer text box: *Footer text was set by your admin*. You cannot edit the footer text for a specific Liveboard; you can only edit it for all Liveboards from the *Admin Console*.

The placement and behavior of the footer differs, depending on the format in which you download an object.

Answer PNG or PDF:: Text appears at the bottom of the page.

Answer CSV or XLSX:: Text appears between the *Data extracted information* row and the *Filter* rows.

Liveboard PDF:: Text appears at the bottom of every page in the PDF.
