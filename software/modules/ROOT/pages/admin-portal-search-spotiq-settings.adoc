You can update the <<search,search settings>> and <<spotiq,SpotIQ settings>>, <<liveboard-experience,Liveboard experience>>, and <<visualization-footer,footer>> from this page.

NOTE: Changing these settings results in a service interruption for all users for approximately 2 minutes. To minimize disruption, consider making your changes during a scheduled maintenance window.

[#search]
== Search settings

Under *Search settings*, you can configure ThoughtSpot’s indexing behavior, and enable or disable summaries and headlines.

To learn more about ThoughtSpot's default indexing behavior, refer to xref:data-modeling-index.adoc[].

To manage search settings, follow these steps:

. Select the *Edit* button in the *Search Settings* section.

. *Index columns*: Click on the toggle to enable or disable ThoughtSpot’s indexing of columns in new connections. If you disable this feature, all columns from new connections are set to `DONT_INDEX`. Note that this change only applies to columns from _new_ connections. You must manually set columns that already exist to `INDEX` or `DONT_INDEX`.

. *Index frequency*: Select a frequency for column indexing from the dropdown. The options are 8, 16, or 24 hours.

. *Summaries and headlines*: Click on the toggle to enable or disable the display of summaries in adhoc search. This setting only affects the display of summaries for users on the xref:answer-experience-new.adoc[new answer experience], not the classic experience.
+
NOTE: This setting does not affect the display of summaries in saved objects, such as saved answers, pinned tables, or headline tiles in Liveboards.


. Select *Save changes*. Alternatively, you can *Reset to default*. By default, ThoughtSpot indexes new columns at a frequency of 24 hours, and enables summaries and headlines.

[#spotiq]
== SpotIQ settings

Under *SpotIQ settings*, you can enable or disable xref:spotiq-custom.adoc[SpotIQ analyze].

To enable or disable SpotIQ Analyze, follow these steps:

. Select the *Edit* button in the *SpotIQ Settings* section.

. Click on the toggle to enable or disable the feature.

. Select *Save changes*. Alternatively, you can *Reset to default*. By default, SpotIQ Analyze is enabled.

[#liveboard-experience]
== Liveboard experience settings
Under *Liveboards experience*, you can manage availability of the xref:liveboard-experience-new.adoc[new Liveboard experience] for all users.

You can turn the new Liveboard experience on or off globally, and specify the default Liveboard experience for all users. For example, you can turn the new Liveboard experience on globally, but keep the classic experience the default, allowing users to opt into the new experience.

To manage the new Liveboard experience, follow these steps:

. Select the *Edit* button in the *Liveboards experience* section.

. Enable or disable the new Liveboard experience.

. If you enable the new Liveboard experience, you can specify whether it should be on by default for all users, or if they should have to opt in.
+
To display the new Liveboard experience to all users, enable the *new Liveboard experience* toggle, then enable the *Make new Liveboard experience default* toggle.
+
To display the classic Liveboard experience to all users, but allow them to turn the new experience on for themselves in their profile, enable the *new Liveboard experience* toggle, then disable the *Make new Liveboard experience default* toggle.

[#visualization-footer]
== Visualization footer settings

NOTE: The visualization footer feature is part of the xref:answer-experience-new.adoc[new answer experience] and the xref:liveboard-experience-new.adoc[new Liveboard experience]. If you are using the classic experiences, you cannot set a standard download footer. If you are using only the new answer experience and not the new Liveboard experience, you can only set a standard download footer for answers, *_not_* Liveboards.

Specify the footer that appears in all downloaded answers and Liveboards. Use this functionality to add a confidentiality disclaimer, for example. You can also allow your users to add their own footers to downloaded Liveboards.

Note that this standard footer does not apply to Liveboards downloaded with the https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/?pageid=liveboard-export-api[Liveboard export API^]. Liveboards downloaded with the API use the footer specified by the `footer_text` API parameter.

To edit the standard footer, follow these steps:

. Select the *Edit* button in the *Visualization* section.

. Edit the text box next to *Downloaded file instructions* with the text you would like to appear in the footer, up to 700 characters.
+
The default footer is *Disclaimer: The information downloaded is confidential*.
+
To allow your users to add their own footers to downloaded Liveboards, remove all content from the text box.

. Select *Save*.

=== Footer behavior

This footer replaces the *Footer text* option that appears when you xref:liveboard-download-pdf.adoc[download a Liveboard as a PDF]. Instead, if you are on the xref:liveboard-experience-new.adoc[new Liveboard experience], you see a note under the footer text box: *Footer text was set by your admin*. You cannot edit the footer text for a specific Liveboard; you can only edit it for all Liveboards from the *Admin Console*.

The placement and behavior of the footer differs, depending on the format in which you download an object.

Answer PNG or PDF:: Text appears at the bottom of the page.

Answer CSV or XLSX:: Text appears between the *Data extracted information* row and the *Filter* rows.

Liveboard PDF:: Text appears at the bottom of every page in the PDF.
