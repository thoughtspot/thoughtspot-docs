== Where can I find the version of ThoughtSpot I am using?

. Select the information center icon image:icon-help-10px.png[], from the top navigation bar.

. Select *Get help*.

. Scroll down to *About*, where you can see the version number.

== I'm not seeing certain columns/values in the drop-down, why?

It could be the index has not built with the latest data or something is causing the column to be dropped.

* Verify the the column is available using the *Data* page.
* View the table columns and check the *INDEX TYPE* value.
If it is set to `DONT_INDEX`, change it.
* Check the column's  *INDEX PRIORITY*.
Make sure it is `1`.
