= Create and load CSV Files

The simplest way to load data is to upload a CSV or Excel file from the ThoughtSpot Web interface.

Loading data through the Web browser is recommended for smaller tables (under 50MB) with simple relationships between them. This method is recommended for small, one time data loads. Using this method, the data schema is created for you automatically.
