= Reaggregation Scenario 1: Supplier tendering by job

:page-partial:

We have a fact table at a job or supplier tender response aggregation level.
There are many rows for each job, where each row is a single row from a supplier.
A competitive tender is a situation when multiple suppliers bid on the same job.

Our objective is to determine what percentage of jobs had more than 1 supplier response.
We want to see high numbers, which indicate that many suppliers bid on the job, so we can select the best response.

sum(group_aggregate(if(sum(# trades tendered ) > 1) then 1 else 0,
                    query_groups() + {claimid, packageid},
                    query_filters()))

== Resolution

. The `sum ( # trades tendered )` function aggregates to these attributes:
 ** `{claimid, packageid}`
+
The job-level identifier

 ** `query_groups( )`
+
Adds any additional columns in the search to this aggregation.
Here, this is the `datelogged` column at the yearly level.

 ** `query_filters ( )`
+
Applies any filters entered in the search.
Here, there are no filters.

. For each row in this virtual table, the conditional `if() then else` function applies.
So, if the sum of tendered responses is greater than 1, then the result returns 1, or else it returns 0.
. The outer function, `sum()`, reaggregates the final output as a single row for each `datelogged` yearly value.
 ** This reaggregation is possible because the conditional statement is inside the `group_aggregate` function.
 ** Rather than return a row for each `{claimid,packageid}`, the function returns a single row for `datelogged yearly`.
 ** The default aggregation setting does not reaggregate the result set.

== Non-aggregated result

include::partial$intro-non-aggregated.adoc[]

In the following scenario, the next statement is the conditional `if` clause.
Because of this, the overall expression does not reaggregate.
The returned result is a row for each `{claimid,packageid}`.

----
sum(if(group_aggregate (sum (# trades tendered),
                              query_groups() + {claimid, packageid},
                              query_filters ( ) )>1) then 1 else 0)
