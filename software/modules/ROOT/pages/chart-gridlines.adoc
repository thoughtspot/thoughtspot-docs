Charts with x- and y-axes can display gridlines.
Y-axis gridlines provide horizontal gridlines, and x-axis gridlines provide vertical gridlines.

To display gridlines, follow these steps:

. While viewing your answer as a chart, select the *chart configuration* icon image:icon-gear-10px.png[Edit chart configuration icon image] on the upper right.
. The *Edit chart* panel appears.
Select the *Settings* menu.
. Select one or both of the gridline options.

X-axis gridlines are useful when you have a more complicated chart.
For example, if you view a column chart for *sales* by *department* and *store region*, you might want to use gridlines to more easily visualize the column groups.
You might also use gridlines when your chart includes a *time* element.
