= Comparative analysis
:last_updated: 11/19/2019

With SpotIQ comparative analysis, you can compare two data points for complex measures.

SpotIQ comparative analysis compares data points of simple or complex measures using these aggregates:

* _Sum_
* _Count_
* _Sum over sum_, which generate a Pinboard that has 'what-if' percentage insights
* _Average_, which generate a Pinboard that has 'what-if' percentage insights
* Other functions which use a 'versus' analysis to show the absolute change grouped by different drill attributes
