SpotApps, ThoughtSpot's scriptable applications, allow you to migrate multiple objects to and from clusters.

SpotApps take advantage of xref:scriptability.adoc[Scriptability], ThoughtSpot's solution for exporting, enhancing, and migrating ThoughtSpot objects, to provide you with scriptable applications you can use in multiple clusters.

After you connect to your data, you can work with your ThoughtSpot contacts to deploy ThoughtSpot's scriptable applications, or SpotApps, which provide an easy way for you to start getting value from your data.

ThoughtSpot offers <<pre-built-spotapps,pre-built SpotApps>>, which leverage your data in your cloud data warehouse to provide pre-built Pinboards, Answers, SpotIQ results, Views, Tables and Worksheets.
You can also <<create-spotapps,create your own SpotApps>> by exporting multiple objects of the same type in one zip file, or an object and its associated data sources, and migrating these objects to another environment.

[#create-spotapps]
== Create and export SpotApps

You can create your own SpotApps in two ways:

You may have a specific Pinboard or other object that you would like to migrate to another cluster, but that cluster may not contain the Worksheets, Tables, or Views that the Pinboard's data comes from.
When you export any Pinboard, Answer, SpotIQ result, Worksheet, or View, you have the option to export its associated data sources as well.
This creates a SpotApp that you can migrate to another cluster without worrying about missing dependencies.
The SpotApp .zip file contains a document called the `Manifest` file, which defines the objects you exported, and their underlying data sources.

Similarly, you might want to migrate all the Answers on one cluster to another.
You can select them all on the *Answers* list page, and export them as a SpotApp in .zip format.
You can also choose to export their associated data sources in the same file.

See xref:scriptability.adoc[Scriptability] for more information on exporting and importing objects.

=== Import SpotApps

You can import SpotApps from the SpotApps page, under menu:Data[SpotApps].

. From the *SpotApps* page under the *Data* tab, click *Import*.
+

. In the *Import* interface, click *Select .tml or .zip files to upload*.
. In your file system, find and select the .zip file for the SpotApp.
. If you constructed the file correctly, the *Import* interface displays a _Validation successful_ message.
You can now import the file.
. You can unselect any files in the `.zip` file you do not want to upload.
. Click *Import selected files*.
. The *Import Status* screen displays the status of the objects you imported.
You can open the object(s) that you imported, or click *Done* to return to the main object page.

[#pre-built-spotapps]
== Pre-built SpotApps

Once you connect to your data, you can work with your ThoughtSpot contacts to deploy ThoughtSpot's pre-built SpotApps, which provide an easy way for you to start getting value from your data. They leverage your data in your cloud data warehouse to provide pre-built Pinboards, Answers, Views, Tables, and Worksheets.

ThoughtSpot offers 1 pre-built SpotApp, for *ServiceNow*. This SpotApp contains a worksheet with your ServiceNow data for your users to query on, as well as several pre-built answers and pinboards based on your data.

When you are ready to move to a production environment, you can migrate these ThoughtSpot objects to your new environment using xref:scriptability.adoc[Scriptability], ThoughtSpot's flat-file editing and migration system for ThoughtSpot objects.

=== Limitations

You cannot import manually compressed .zip files.
You can only import .zip files that you exported from ThoughtSpot: either an object and its associated data sources, or multiple objects of the same type that you exported from the object list page.
