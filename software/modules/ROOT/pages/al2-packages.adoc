ThoughtSpot also uses the third-party software packages listed in xref:third-party.adoc[].

To successfully deploy ThoughtSpot in your organization, you must have the following packages on each node of your ThoughtSpot cluster: yum, python 3, and R.
When the Ansible playbook runs, it automatically installs them.

ThoughtSpot works with the latest version of each package.
