You can prevent ThoughtSpot from recommending other chart options or configurations while you search.
For example, if you want to view an answer as a line chart, you can lock that display and stop ThoughtSpot from recommending an alternative visualization, such as a funnel or pie chart.
A lock persists as you make changes to the columns in your answer, and persists if you save the answer and come back to it later.

To disable auto-selection of chart types:

. Pick the chart type you want to use for your visualization.
. Click the *change visualization* icon image:icon-chart-type-10px.png[] at the top right to open the *chart catalog*.
. In the bottom right corner of the *Chart* menu, turn off *automatically select my chart*.
