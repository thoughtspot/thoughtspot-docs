== Configuring OAuth

If you plan to use OAuth with Synapse, you must configure it before you can create a connection. For details, see xref:connections-synapse-oauth.adoc[Configure OAuth for a Synapse connection].

== Adding a Synapse connection
To add a connection to Synapse:

. Click *Data* in the top navigation bar.
. Click the *Connections* tab at the top of the page, and click *+ Add connection* at the upper-right-hand side of the page.
+

// ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/new-connection.png "New db connect")

. Create a name for your connection, a description (optional), then select the Synapse connection type, and click *Continue*.

. Select *Use Service Account*, or *Use OAuth*, and enter the connection details for your Synapse data source.
+
NOTE: To use SQL Server with your Synapse connection, select *Use Service Account*.
+

+
For Service Account authentication, do the following:

** Enter Host, Port, User, Password, and Database.
+
[IMPORTANT]
.SQL Server configuration
====
If you are using SQL Server, do the following:

* For Port, enter *1433*.
* For User, enter the login for your SQL Server database.
====
+
--
For OAuth authentication, do the following:

** Enter Host, Port, OAuth Client ID, OAuth Client Secret, Scope, Auth Url, Access token Url, and Database.
--
Refer to the xref:connections-synapse-reference.adoc[Synapse connection reference] for more information on each of the specific attributes you must enter for your connection.

. (Optional) Provide additional key-value pairs that you need to set up your connection to Synapse or customize additional JDBC parameters supported by Synapse, by doing the following:
 ** Click the *Advanced Config* menu to reveal the *Key* and *Value* fields.
 ** Enter your key and value information. Refer to Synapse's JDBC driver reference documentation for information on Synapse's supported keys and values.
 ** To add more keys and values, click the plus sign (+), and enter them.

+
NOTE: Any key-value pairs that you enter must be defined in your Synapse data source. Key-value pairs are case-sensitive.

. Click *Continue*.
. Select tables (on the left) and the columns from each table (on the right), and then click *Create connection*.
+

// ![Select tables and columns for your connection]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/synapse-selecttables.png "Select tables and columns for your connection")
+
A message appears indicating the number of tables and columns that will be added to your connection.

. Click *Confirm*.
+
After you add the connection, you can search your Synapse database right away by clicking *Search now*.
+

+
Your new connection appears on the *Data* > *Connections* page.
You can click the name of your connection to view the tables and columns in your connection.

The connection you just created is a link to the external data source.
If there are any joins in the selected tables of the external data source, those are imported into ThoughtSpot.

You can now perform a live query on the selected tables and columns of your connection.
Because the selected tables and columns in your connection are linked, it may take a while to initially render the search results.
This is because ThoughtSpot does not cache linked data.
With linked data, ThoughtSpot queries the external database directly, which is slower than querying data that is stored in ThoughtSpot's database.
