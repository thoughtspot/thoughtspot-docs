You can add a simple filter from a column header while viewing your answer as a table.

To add a filter from column headers:

. While viewing your answer as a table, hover over the column header you want to filter, and select the *More* menu icon image:icon-more-10px.png[more options menu icon].
. Select *Filter*.
. The filter modals for attributes and measures are different. The modal for an attribute looks like this:
+
image::filter-attribute.png[Attribute filter modal]
+
The modal for a measure looks like this:
+
image::filter-measure.png[Measure filter modal]

. For an attribute filter, select values to include or exclude. You can also *select all* or *clear all*. If there are too many values, you can use the filter search bar to find the ones you want. The filter modal only shows 500 values; if the column you selected has more than 500 values, you must use the filter search bar to find the additional values.

. For a measure filter, select *Add a condition*. Choose an operator, such as `is greater than`, and enter a number. For example, to see under-performing stores, with sales under 10 million, select *is less than or equal to* and enter `10 million`. To add another filter for that measure, select *Add another*.

. Select *Done*.
