= Save a search as a view
:last_updated: 11/2/2018

If you want to search on top of another search, try saving your search as a View.
Then, you can use the saved View as a data source for a new search.

This procedure walks you through creating a View from a search.
To create a View from a search:

. Start a new search, or edit an existing visualization from a Pinboard.
+
Any filters or aggregations created during this search will be reflected in the View.

. Make any changes to the visualization that you want in your saved View (change aggregation level, filters, etc.)
. Click the *More* menu icon image:icon-more-10px.png[more options menu icon], and *Save as view*.

. Give the View a name and save it.
+
image::save_view_dialog.png[]

. xref:create-new-relationship.adoc[Link] your View to any other data source, or xref:constraints.adoc[define joins].

At this point the View has been saved, but you may also want to xref:materialized-views.adoc[materialize the View], to improve its performance when searching.
