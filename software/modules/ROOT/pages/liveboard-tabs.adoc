include::partial$liveboard-tabs-intro.adoc[]

To share a tab, you must share the entire Liveboard. Refer to xref:share-liveboards.adoc[]. However, tabs have their own URL, so you can copy the URL to a specific tab to send to someone.

== Adding tabs
To add new tabs to a Liveboard, you must first be in *Edit* mode. Note that a Liveboard can have a maximum of 20 tabs.

. Select the *Edit* button at the upper right of the Liveboard.

. Select *+ Add tab* in the top menu.

. If the Liveboard already has at least one tab, the new tab appears, with no visualizations in it yet. If the Liveboard does not have any tabs yet, the new tab contains all the visualizations currently in the Liveboard.

. Name the tab. If the name is more than 30 characters, the entire name does not appear. ThoughtSpot cuts it off with an ellipsis. You can copy and paste small images or icons to make the tab names more descriptive.
+
You can add html to the tab name. For example, you can add icons to the tab name: `<img src="kpi-logo.png" alt="Key performance indicators logo"> KPIs`. For more information, see xref:chart-html.adoc[].

=== Renaming tabs
To rename a tab, follow these steps.

. Select the *Edit* button at the upper right of the Liveboard.

. Double-click on the name of the tab you would like to rename. Alternatively, select the dropdown arrow next to the name of the tab, and select *Rename*.

. Type in the new name for the tab.

. Select *Save* in the top menu.

[#modify]
=== Modifying tab visualizations

. Select the *Edit* button at the upper right of the Liveboard.

. Select the *More* menu image:icon-more-10px.png[more menu icon] for the visualization you would like to delete or move to another tab.

. To delete the visualization, select *Delete*. This removes the visualization from that tab only.

. To move the visualization to another tab, select *Move to tab*. This option is not available if the Liveboard has only one tab. Select the tab to move the visualization to from the list, and select *Move*.

. Select *Save* in the top menu.

[#rearrange]
=== Rearranging tabs
You can modify the order the tabs appear in. To rearrange tabs, follow these steps:

. Select the *Edit* button at the upper right of the Liveboard.
. Click on a tab name and drag and drop it to a new position.
. Select *Save* in the top menu.

== Deleting tabs

When you delete a tab, ThoughtSpot deletes all the visualizations in the tab. However, if the Liveboard only has one tab, ThoughtSpot does not delete the visualizations. ThoughtSpot just removes the tab itself.

To delete a tab, follow these steps:

. Select the *Edit* button at the upper right of the Liveboard.

. Select the dropdown arrow next to the name of the tab you would like to delete.

. Select *Delete*. If the Liveboard only has one tab, select *Remove*.

. If the Liveboard has multiple tabs, a confirmation pop-up appears to warn you that this action deletes all the visualizations in the tab. If the tab has no visualizations, no pop-up appears. If the Liveboard has one tab, no pop-up appears. ThoughtSpot removes the tab, but not the visualizations.

. Select *Delete* again.

. Select *Save* in the top menu.

== Limitations

Liveboard tabs are not available on xref:mobile.adoc[ThoughtSpot's mobile application].
