You can embed ThoughtSpot in an external application, website, or portal.

ThoughtSpot Extended Enterprise Edition lets you give people outside of your company access to some ThoughtSpot capabilities within the context of an external application, website, or portal.
We call these people "`external users`".
For example, you could give external users access to data, search, search results, data visualizations, and/or pinboards.

External users cannot be granted administrative privileges or receive technical support from ThoughtSpot.
All first-line support must be handled through your company or organization.

ThoughtSpot Extended Enterprise Edition includes these capabilities:
