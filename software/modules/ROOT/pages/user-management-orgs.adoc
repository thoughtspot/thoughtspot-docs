= Create, edit, or delete a user in a multi-tenant environment
:last_updated: 9/26/2022

:description: For each person who accesses ThoughtSpot, you must create an account. When you create a user manually in ThoughtSpot, you manage that user in ThoughtSpot.


You can create users directly in ThoughtSpot, or import users and user groups through SAML or similar protocols.

For users who have access through SAML, the SAML installation manages all user information.

Depending on whether you are a cluster administrator or an Org administrator, you have different levels of administrator access. Cluster administrators can see, create, and manage users in any Org; Org administrators can only see, create, and manage users in the Org(s) for which they are admins.

[NOTE]
====
This article contains instructions for managing users if your company does *_NOT_* use Identity and Access Management V2 (IAMv2). IAMv2 is *_off_* by default. If the *Users* section of the Admin Console does *_not_* contain an *Account Activation* column, your company is *_not_* using IAMv2.

If the *Users* section of the Admin Console contains an *Account Activation* column, your company is using IAMv2. 

//Refer to xref:user-management-okta.adoc[].
====

[NOTE]
====
This article contains instructions for managing users if your company uses the xref:orgs-overview.adoc[Orgs] feature for multi-tenancy in ThoughtSpot. If you have an Org switcher to the left of the help icon in the top navigation bar, your company is using Orgs.

If you do not have an Org switcher between the help icon and the *Search answers and Liveboards* search box, your company is *_not_* using Orgs. Refer to xref:user-management.adoc[].

[#add-user]
== Create a user in ThoughtSpot

This procedure demonstrates how to create a user manually.
When you create a user, you can specify the _<<username,username>>_, _<<display-name,display name>>_, _<<sharing-visibility,sharing visibility>>_, the _<<password,password>>_, _<<email,email>>_, whether they get a _<<email-welcome,welcome email>>_ and its _<<email-text,text>>_, and assign _<<groups,group>>_ memberships.
The user inherits privileges and permissions directly from the group assignments.

Note that all users automatically belong to the group *All*.

To create a new user and assign that user to groups or Orgs, follow these steps:

. Ensure that you are in the correct Org. If you are a cluster administrator, you can manage all users in all Orgs from the Primary Org. If you are an Org administrator, you must navigate to the specific Org the users you must manage are in. Use the Org Switcher to the left of the help menu in the top navigation bar.

. Navigate to the Admin Console by selecting the *Admin* tab from the top navigation bar.
.  If you are a cluster administrator in the Primary Org, select *All orgs* from the side navigation bar.
. Select *Users* from the side navigation bar that appears.
+
//image::admin-portal-users-orgs.png[Admin Console - Users]- waiting for sw cluster with orgs enabled for sw specific image

. Select the *+ Add User* button on the upper-left side of the list of users.
. In the *Add a new user* interface, enter the details for the new user.
+
NOTE: You see a different interface, depending on whether you are adding the new user from the *All orgs* section of the Admin Console, or from a specific Org. From *All orgs*, you can add the new user to multiple Orgs. From the specific Org, you can add the new user to groups.
+

+
[#username]
Username::
A login name for the user. Usernames must be unique and lowercase. If you are using Active Directory to authenticate users, and your LDAP configuration requires users to be created manually (they are not created automatically in ThoughtSpot upon authentication), the username you specify has to be domain-qualified (`username@ldap.thoughtspot.com`), and you must enter a dummy password.
[#display-name]
Display name::
A unique name for the user (usually their first and last name).
[#sharing-visibility]
Sharing visibility::
Indicate whether objects can be shared with this user. When set to *SHAREABLE*, this user is an option in the *Share* dialog.
[#password]
Change password::
Add or change the password. Your password must meet the following requirements:
* The password must be 8 characters or more in length.
* The password must include at least 1 uppercase letter, 1 lowercase letter, 1 number, and 1 special character.
* The password must pass a complexity test based on an external library. This test ensures password complexity and uniqueness by checking for known patterns or words that are too simple. If the password is not complex enough, ThoughtSpot rejects it, even if it fulfills the other requirements. Refer to the https://github.com/dropbox/zxcvbn[Dropbox password library^] for more information.
* The password cannot use certain blocked words. By default, the blocked words are: your username, any part of your display name, and any blocked words your company configures. To add additional words to the blocklist, contact {support-url}.
Confirm password::
Enter the password again.
[#email]
Email::
The user's email address. ThoughtSpot uses this for  notification when another user shares something with them, for onboarding, and others.
+
NOTE: During cluster configuration, the administrator specifies the email server domain. ThoughtSpot does not accept emails outside this domain. Contact {support-url} to add new domains to a list of allowed domains.
[#email-welcome]
Send a welcome email::
(Optional) When checked, this option ensures that the new user receives a welcome email. You can customize other aspects of the onboarding email, such as the email address ThoughtSpot sends it from, from the *Onboarding* section of the Admin Console. Refer to xref:onboarding-email-settings.adoc[].
[#email-text]
Email message text::
(Optional) Enter text of the optional welcome email here.
[#groups]
Groups::
(Recommended) Select the groups for the user. This option appears when you add a user from a specific Org.
+
[NOTE]
====
When you create a new user, the groups they belong to define the following attributes for the user:

Privileges:: the actions they can perform, defined when you xref:group-management.adoc[add a group and set security privileges]

Permissions:: the data they can access and view, defined when you consider xref:data-security.adoc[data security]

Administrators can see all data sources, and xref:security-rls.adoc[row-level security] does not apply to them.
====
+
WARNING: If you add the user to a group that has the privilege *Has administration privileges*, they can see all the data in their Org. If you add the user to a group *in the Primary Org* that has the privilege *Has administration privileges*, they can see all the data in _every_ Org.
+
[#orgs]
Orgs::
(Recommended) Select the Org(s) for the user. This option appears when you add a user from the *All orgs* section of the Admin Console in the Primary Org.

. Select *Add* to create the user.

Note that this process of identifying the user's needs contributes to a robust onboarding process.
See xref:onboarding.adoc[Onboarding users].

[#edit-user]
== Edit an existing user

As an administrator, you can edit a user account, and change the user's groups or Orgs.
You can also help users by resetting their password, and evaluating their onboarding experience to ensure they receive the best possible introduction to relevant information in ThoughtSpot.

To edit an existing user, follow these steps:

. Ensure that you are in the correct Org. If you are a cluster administrator, you can manage all users in all Orgs from the Primary Org.

+
You can change the _<<username,username>>_, _<<display-name,display name>>_, _<<sharing-visibility,sharing visibility>>_, _<<password,passwords>>_, and _<<email,user's email>>_.
