Use this procedure to obtain the Microsoft Windows ODBC driver and install it.

ThoughtSpot's ODBC connection relies on the https://www.simba.com/products/SEN/doc/Client-Server_user_guide/content/clientserver/configuringsimbaclientodbc/simbaclientodbcunix.htm[SimbaEngine X SDK^] to connect through ODBC or JDBC to ThoughtSpot's remote data stores.
The instructions on this page explain how to configure the Simba ODBC driver on a Windows workstation.

Make sure you have read the overview material in the xref:odbc.adoc[ODBC driver overview].
This workstation is the same machine where you plan to run your ETL activities.

== Prerequisites

These instructions include directions to use the `ssh` command.
Make sure your Windows workstation is equipped with a tool https://www.putty.org/[such as Putty] for making `ssh` connections to your ThoughtSpot server.

The ODBC driver for Windows requires Visual C{pp} Redistributable for Visual Studio 2013.
You are prompted to install it during installation of the driver if it isn't already installed.

To check if this Microsoft tool is already installed, search for it on your computer.

If it isn't installed, make sure you https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40784[download and install it] before continuing.

== Check the ThoughtSpot IP and the simba_server status

include::partial$simba-server-start.adoc[]

== Download the driver

On the workstation where you want to connect from, do the following:

. Navigate to the xref:downloads.adoc[*Downloads*] page.
. Download the *ODBC Driver for Windows*.
. Unzip the file you downloaded at a convenient location on your workstation.

. Take a moment to examine the contents of the new directory.
+
There are two different Windows ODBC installers included in the file you downloaded.

 ** ThoughtSpotODBC (x86).msi for Windows 32-bit
 ** ThoughtSpotODBC (x64).msi for Windows 64-bit

== Install the driver and supporting software

The installation process installs the Simba driver and adds the ODBC Administrator software to your workstation.
You use this software to configure the driver.

. Launch the installer for your version of Windows.
. Select *Next* to continue.
+

. Accept the End User License Agreement (EULA), and select *Next*.
. Specify the destination folder where the driver will be installed.
+

. Enter the ThoughtSpot server details, and select *Next*.
+
image::odbc_install_4.png[Specify the server IPs and the Database name]

 ** For *Server(s)*, provide a comma separated list of the IP addresses of each node on the ThoughtSpot instance.
 ** For *Database*, optionally specify the database to use.
If you skip this entry, you must provide the database each time you connect using ODBC.

. Confirm that the install can begin by selecting *Install*.
. You may see a security warning.

. Select *Yes* to continue.
+
A confirmation message appears when the installation is complete.

. Select *Finish*.

== Configure the driver and test your connection

After installation completes, use the ODBC Administrator to configure the ODBC connection on your Windows workstation.
For example, you may want to add a default schema or change the server IP address or the default database.

It is recommended to add a default schema.
If you don't specify a default schema, you must supply it every time you use the ODBC driver.

At this point, you can test your ODBC connection to ThoughtSpot.
It is important to recall that the username/password you use belongs to a ThoughtSpot application user.
Typically, this user is a user with data management or administrative privileges on the application.

. Before trying the ODBC connection, confirm a username/password that can sign in to the ThoughtSpot applications.
. Select the *Data* tab, and confirm the user's privileges.
. Return to your workstation.
. Locate and open the *ODBC Data Source Administrator (64-bit)* application.

. Select the *System DSN* tab.

. Select *ThoughtSpot* and click *Configure...*
+
image::odbc-system-dsn.png[Click System DSN from the top navigation bar.]

. Select *Options...*
+
image::odbc-configure-dialog.png[Click Options...]
. Ensure you have the following *Custom Property* values set:
+
|===
| Custom Property | Value

| `SCHEMA`
| `falcon_default_schema` is the default

| `UID`
| The username of a user with data management privilege.

| `PWD`
| The password for the username you specify.
|===
+
You don't have to use the ThoughtSpot default schema.
You can specify your own.
We recommend that you define a default schema.
Otherwise, you must supply a schema  every time you use the ODBC driver.
Moreover, without a schema (or if the  schema isn't present), the ODBC driver returns an error that states that the schema could not be found.
+
Similarly, adding the `UID` and `PWD` properties aren't required.
If you  don't add them, you are prompted to supply them each time you connect.
+
When you are done, your options should look similar to the following:
+
image::windows-odbc-options.png[Options pop-up. SSL is disabled. There are 6 custom properties: database, msgfetchsize, pushedparamcachesize, pwd, schema, uid.]

. When you are done, select *OK* to save your new properties.
. Select *Test Connection* to test your database connection.
+
image::windows-odbc-success.png[DSN Configuration success message]

. Select *Cancel* to close the *DSN Configuration* dialog.
. Select *OK* to close the *Client Configuration Dialog* the dialog.
. Select *OK* to close the *ODBC Data Source Administrator (64-bit)* application.

Now, you are ready to begin using the connection you've configured.
