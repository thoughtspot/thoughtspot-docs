Learn how to view or edit a formula.

You can always go back and view or edit a formula that was added to a search.
Do this by selecting the edit icon next to its name in the *Columns* listing.
Anyone who has edit privileges on an answer can also edit any formulas it contains.
To view or edit an existing formula in an answer:

. Navigate to the answer whose formula you would like to edit. If the answer is within a Liveboard, select the ellipsis menu image:icon-more-10px.png[more icon] for that answer and click Edit.

. Open the *Data* panel from the upper-right corner of the *Search* page. Expand the *Formulas* section in the Data panel. You can see a list of all the formulas in the answer.

. Select the edit icon image:icon-edit-10px.png[edit icon] next to the formula name.
. View or edit your formula in the Formula Editor.

Otherwise, select *Cancel*.
