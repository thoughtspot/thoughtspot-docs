NOTE: The formula editor redesign is part of the xref:answer-experience-new.adoc[new answer experience]. The new answer experience is on by default. If you have the classic answer experience on, your user interface and experience may be different from the experience described in this article. You can turn the new answer experience on or off individually from the *Experience manager* panel in xref:user-profile.adoc#new-answer-experience[your profile]. If that option is not available, contact your administrator.

Learn how to view or edit a formula.

You can always go back and view or edit a formula that was added to a search.
Do this by clicking the edit icon next to its name in the *Columns* listing.
Anyone who has edit privileges on an answer can also edit any formulas it contains.
To view or edit an existing formula in an answer:

. Navigate to the answer whose formula you would like to edit. If the answer is within a Liveboard, select the ellipsis menu image:icon-more-10px.png[more icon] for that answer and click Edit.

. Open the *Data* panel from the upper right corner of the *Search* page. Expand the *Formulas* section in the Data panel. You can see a list of all the formulas in the answer.

. Click the edit icon image:icon-edit-10px.png[edit icon] next to the formula name.
. View or edit your formula in the Formula Editor.
