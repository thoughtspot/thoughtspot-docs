NOTE: The formula editor redesign is part of the xref:answer-experience-new.adoc[new answer experience]. The new answer experience is in [.label.label-beta]#Beta# and off by default, but the option to turn it on or off individually is on by default. If you have the new answer experience on, your user interface and experience may be different from the experience described in this article. You can turn the new answer experience on or off individually from the *Experience manager* panel in xref:user-profile.adoc#new-answer-experience[your profile]. If that option is not available, contact your administrator.
