:description: ThoughtSpot can encrypt data in transit within a cluster.

ThoughtSpot can encrypt data in transit within a cluster.

== Overview

ThoughtSpot supports encryption of data in transit within a cluster (traffic flowing between multiple nodes in a cluster).
Encryption in transit within the cluster is primarily needed for cloud deployments of ThoughtSpot.
This is accomplished using IPSec.

IPSec operates in two modes: tunnel mode and transport mode.
ThoughtSpot recommends using *transport mode* to set up IPSec for encrypting in-transit data.

NOTE: While IPSec provides additional security, it also reduces network bandwidth between nodes.

ThoughtSpot supports IPSec encryption using strongSwan (an open-source IPSec-based VPN solution for Linux and other UNIX based operating systems).

Summary:

. Use IPSec in Transport mode for host-to-host IPSec communication.
. Use the strongSwan package.
. Use AES-GCM for ESP protocol (since it provides authenticated encryption and provides better network bandwidth).

NOTE: IPSec is supported in ThoughtSpot software versions starting from 4.5.1.4

== Deployment

. *Enabling IPSec*: Run following command on any ThoughtSpot node after cluster has been configured and right built has been deployed: `# tscli ipsec enable`.
. *Disabling IPSec*: Run following command on any node of the cluster: `# tscli ipsec disable`.
. *Checking status of IPSec*: Run following command on any node of the cluster `# tscli ipsec status`.
. IPSec configuration and settings are NOT persistent across cluster backup/restore and will have to be re-enabled.
. *Adding a node in an IPSec enabled cluster*: IPSec settings are automatically configured across nodes as a nodes get added to a ThoughtSpot cluster that has IPSec enabled.
. *Removing a node in IPSec enabled cluster*: IPSec settings are not impacted when nodes get removed from a ThoughtSpot cluster that has IPSec enabled.
If any failure occurs during node removal, IPSec would need to re-enabled by using the following command: `tscli ipsec enable`.
. *Manually enable/disable IPSec on a single node(if any IPSec related failure occurs on that node)*: +
Manually enable and start strongSwan: +
`sudo systemctl enable strongswan` +
`sudo systemctl start strongswan`
+
Manually stop and disable strongSwan: +
`sudo systemctl stop strongswan` +
`sudo systemctl disable strongswan`
+
NOTE: You can check  `/etc/strongswan/ipsec.conf` and `/etc/strongswan/ipsec.secrets` on each node to verify that they are consistent across all nodes.

== Firewall configuration

The following ports and protocols must be open between nodes to allow IPSec encryption:

NOTE: If you deploy ThoughtSpot in Microsoft Azure, you cannot use the Azure web portal to add IP protocol 50. You must use the https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/network/nsg/rule?view=azure-cli-latest[Azure CLI^] or https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/az.network/new-aznetworksecurityruleconfig?view=azps-6.5.0[Powershell^].
