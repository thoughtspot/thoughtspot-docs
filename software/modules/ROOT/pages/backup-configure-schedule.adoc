Learn how to configure automatic periodic backups.

You can configure ThoughtSpot to back up automatically at specified times.
The policy allows you to control the type, frequency, retention periods (first-in-first-out), and output location for a periodic backup.

A periodic backup uses the same steps as creating a backup manually.
However, you do not have to specify a snapshot name.
The system uses the most recent snapshot.
You can back up to a local file system, xref:nas-mount.adoc[mount a NAS (network attached storage) file system] to hold the backup, or xref:aws-backup-restore.adoc[back up to an S3 bucket].
A NAS file system is recommended.
Make sure you have adequate space to store the number of backups you want to archive.

== Default policy format

This is the format for a backup policy.
Note that the command populates several parameters with their defaults.
The default `mode` is `FULL`, the `type` is `STANDALONE`, and the `storage_type` is `NAS`.
You can change the `mode` and `storage_type`, and you must specify a `directory` and a `name`.

[NOTE]
====
The longest possible backup schedule you can configure is one week. This configuration should be entered as:

[source]
schedule {
period {
number: 7
unit: DAY
    }
}

ThoughtSpot does not generate an error for periods greater than seven days, but the snapshot will not be created.
====

[source]
----
name: "name_for_backup"
param {
    mode: FULL | DATALESS | LIGHTWEIGHT
    type: STANDALONE
}
schedule {
    period {
      number: integer
      unit: MINUTE | HOUR | DAY
    }
    retention_policy {
          time {
          number: integer
          unit:  MINUTE | HOUR | DAY
        }
        capacity: integer
      }
  }
  offset_minutes_from_sunday_midnight: integer
}
directory: "NAME"
storage_type: NAS | LOCAL | S3
enabled: true (required for any periodic backup)
bucket_name: "your-S3-bucket-name-in-quotes" (You only need this parameter if your storage_type is S3. The bucket name must be in quotes.)
----

NOTE: To periodically back up your cluster to an S3 bucket, specify `S3` for the `storage_type`, and include the `enabled` and `bucket_name` parameters.

== Before you begin

Before creating a policy, make sure you have read xref:backup-schedule.adoc[Understand backup/snapshot schedules] for information on configuring a `schedule` element.
In addition, you must specify the following parameters:

|===
| Element | Description

| `name`
| Specify a name for your backup, so you can identify it later.

| `mode`
| The backup mode.
`FULL` backups are necessary for restoring a cluster.
See xref:backup-modes.adoc[understand backup modes] for details on each backup mode.

| `type`
| Only `STANDALONE` is supported.

| `directory`
| The location on the disk to place the backup.
You specify an existing directory path, but the folder (the last part of the path: `/home/admin/<folder>`) *must not* already exist.
ThoughtSpot creates the folder when it runs a backup.

| `storage_type`
| The type of storage you are using.
`NAS` storage is recommended for `FULL` backups.
|===

== Create a backup policy

Backups cannot start when another backup is still running.
Choose a reasonable frequency for the backup mode in your policy.
For example, a `FULL` backup takes longer than a `DATALESS` backup.
Consider the load on the system when configuring.
Do not back up when the system would experience a heavy load.
For example, you may want to take `FULL` backups late in the evening or on weekends.

The retention system deletes the oldest stored backup and the corresponding snapshot on a first-in-first-out basis (FIFO).
This means that if you set a bucket retention of 1, the system stores a single backup at any one time.
The system deletes the older backup after the new full backup is successful.

=== Configure using tscli

To configure periodic backups using the tscli:

. Log in to the Linux shell using SSH.
+
[source,console]
----
 $ ssh admin@<cluster-IP>
----

. Find a directory with enough disk space to support the `retention_policy number` you configure.
+
You can use `df -h` to see free disk space and `tscli snapshot ls` to view existing snapshots and their size on disk.

. Use the `tscli backup-policy create` command.
+
[source,console]
----
 $ tscli backup-policy create
----
+
The command opens a `vi` editor for you to configure the backup policy.

. Write and save the file to store your configuration.
+
By default, newly created policies are automatically enabled.
To disable a policy, use the `tscli backup-policy disable` command.

=== Doing more with backup

The following table lists some additional backup commands you can use.

|===
| To | Command

| List present backup policies.
a| `tscli backup-policy ls`

| Show a backup policy.
a| `tscli backup-policy show <name>`

| Check the status of a policy.
a| `tscli backup-policy status <name>`

| Change an existing policy.
a| `tscli backup-policy update <name>`

| Disable or enable an existing policy.
a| `tscli backup-policy disable` or `enable`

| Delete a policy
a| `tscli backup-policy delete <name>`
|===

Finally, you can time a `crontab` job with your periodic backup configuration to move a backup to longer term storage.
Simply create a `crontab` job that moves the backup to a location outside of the `directory` defined in the periodic schedule.
