= Geo map reference
:last_updated: 6/30/2020

ThoughtSpot recognizes and supports a broad list of geographic regions and their subdivisions.

This reference lists supported countries and their subdivisions.
ThoughtSpot renders these regions in geo maps.

You may have to make changes to your data to support geo maps. For example, you may be collecting data for locations in Washington County, Alabama, and also for locations in Washington County, Wisconsin. According to the 2010 Census, there are 31 distinct Washington Counties in the United States. To account for multiple different geographical entities with the same name, you must be specific within your data. A value of _Washington County_ without a state attached to it may result in incorrect or incomplete geo maps.

== Download the supported geo maps CSV file
You can download a CSV file containing all the supported values for geo map countries, codes, and subdivisions. Use this file to confirm that your own geographical values are in the right format, and that ThoughtSpot supports them. Download the CSV file link:{attachmentsdir}/geomaps-supported-countries-codes-subdivisions-6.2.csv[here].

NOTE: The CSV file contains leading 0s where these zeros are present for ThoughtSpot at the beginning of zip/post code values. However, if you import this file into Excel or another spreadsheet tool, that tool may remove leading zeros, resulting in data that does not match ThoughtSpot's format.
