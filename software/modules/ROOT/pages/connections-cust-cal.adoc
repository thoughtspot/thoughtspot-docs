With a custom calendar, you can choose when the year, quarter, or week starts, and search using date-related keywords.

You can create custom calendars for different purposes within your company, including:

* Retail calendars, like 4-4-5, 4-5-4, or 5-4-4
* Fiscal calendars, where the year or quarter starts on a different date each year
* Pharmaceutical calendars, where the week runs from Friday through Thursday
* Calendars in different languages

IMPORTANT: This documentation describes custom calendar for Connections only. For details on custom calendar for ThoughtSpot's Falcon database, see xref:custom-calendar.adoc[Set up custom calendars]

== Options

In a custom calendar, you can set the following:

* The starting date of a year
* The starting dates of quarters
* The starting day of the month
* The starting day of the week
* The words used for the days of the week, months and quarters

== Supported cloud data warehouses

Custom calendar currently supports the following:

* Amazon Redshift
* Databricks
* Google BigQuery
* Microsoft Azure Synapse
* Oracle
* SAP HANA
* Snowflake
* Teradata

== Search features

You can use your custom calendar to search the following ways:

* Using date keywords, like `this quarter` and `q3`
* Using date formulas with the `fiscal` option specified (See xref:formulas-date.adoc#fiscal-and-gregorian-calendars[Fiscal and Gregorian calendars])
* Overriding the calendar used in the search bar by typing your custom calendar's name
* Binding a calendar with a column under the table detail page.
Example: Binding `Lineorder` `commitdate` with the French calendar.
* Specifying a calendar in the formula

== Limitations

Before you create a custom calendar, make sure to review the following limitations.

=== Creating a custom calendar

* ThoughtSpot doesn't support month offset when creating a custom calendar using the: 4-4-5, 4-5-4, or 5-4-4 calendar type configurations. Month offset is a separate calendar type.
* When uploading files, the date format must be _MM/DD/YYYY_. No other formats are supported.
* The file must be sorted based on the date in ascending order.
* The file format should be UTF-8.

=== Using a custom calendar

* Formulas are limited to defining a single custom calendar.
* *VS* supports multiple custom calendars as long as there is only a single calendar per clause.

=== Updating a custom calendar

The values in the generated calendar table can be updated to meet your specific business requirements. Before updating your calendar, be aware of the following:

* `day_of_week`, `month`, `quarter`, and `year` are defined as varchar columns. The expected values are strings rather than numbers. If numbers are defined, the value may not be displayed as an indexed option.

Examples:

** `day_of_week: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday` rather than `day_of_week: 1, 2, 3`
** `quarter: Q1, Q2` rather than `quarter: 1, 2`
** `end_of_``[_period_]``\_epoch` value should be the same as the `start_of_``[_period_]``_epoch` value for the next period. This is because the code is greater than or equal to the start value and less than the end value.

== Prerequisites

* Before you can create a custom calendar, you must contact {support-url} to enable the custom calendar feature on your cluster.
* For a user to create a custom calendar, they must have the required permissions to create a table in the database used in the connection where they want to create their custom calendar.
