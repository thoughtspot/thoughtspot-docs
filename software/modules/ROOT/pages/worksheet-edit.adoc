:description: Anyone with the proper permissions can edit or rename a worksheet.


Anyone with the proper permissions can edit a worksheet. If you created a worksheet, or you have edit permissions on it, you can make changes such as adding sources and columns, adding or editing formulas, changing relationships, and changing column names.
You can also rename a worksheet or change its description.

Alternatively, you can export a worksheet as a flat file in xref:tml.adoc[TML], ThoughtSpot's Modeling Language, edit the file, and import the file to the same or another cluster.
See xref:scriptability.adoc[Migrate or restore objects].
