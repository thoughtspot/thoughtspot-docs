= Configure AWS Secrets Manager
:last_updated: 11/23/2021
:linkattrs:
:experimental:

With AWS Secrets Manager you can store your Redshift password in your own hosted AWS Secrets Manager, so ThoughtSpot can fetch it when needed.
This eliminates the need for you to enter the password when you create a new Redshift connection.

== Prerequisites

- Hosted AWS Secrets Manager solution
- ThoughtSpot cluster deployed on Amazon EC2 instance
- AWS Secrets Manager feature enabled by contacting xref:support-contact.adoc[ThoughtSpot Support].

        	]
    	}
  ]
}

=== Access secrets across AWS accounts

This section details the configuration required to access secrets across AWS accounts.

In the following example, there are two different AWS accounts. The first is a PRODUCTION account (the account where you run applications) and the other is a CENTRAL_SECURITY account (the account where you manage secrets). In your configuration you would use your specific account, key, secret, and role names. 

1. On the CENTRAL_SECURITY account:
.. Create an AWS key as described in the xref:create-aws-kms[Creating and storing the AWS KMS] section.
.. Create an AWS secret as mentioned in the xref:create-store-secret[Creating and storing the secret] section.
.. Create an IAM role with a policy which allows permissions for secrets and a KMS decryption used for the secrets as described in the xref:create-store-iam-policy[Creating and storing the IAM Policy] and the xref:create-store-iam-role[Creating and storing the IAM Role] sections.
.. Also under the trust relationships in IAM role, add the PRODUCTION account IAM role details to assume it.
+
Example:
+
[source,JSON]
----
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
	{
  	"Effect": "Allow",
  	"Principal": {
    	"Service": "ec2.amazonaws.com"
  	},
  	"Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
	},
	{
  	"Sid": "VisualEditor3",
  	"Effect": "Allow",
  	"Principal": {
    	"AWS": "arn:aws:iam::982380164364:role/production_role"
  	},
  	"Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
	}
  ]
----

2. On the PRODUCTION account, create an IAM role with a policy which assumes the CENTRAL_SECURITY account IAM role where secrets are defined.
+
Example:
+
[source,JSON]
----
{
	"Version": "2012-10-17",
	"Statement": [
    	{
        	"Sid": "VisualEditor0",
        	"Effect": "Allow",
        	"Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
        	"Resource": [
            	"arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/central_security_role"
        	]
    	}
	]
}
----

3. Attach the PRODUCTION account IAM role to EC2 instance, by following the steps in xref:attach-iam-role-instance[Attach an IAM role to an instance].
