== Querying your external tables

To query your external tables in ThoughtSpot, follow these steps:

. Ensure that {connection} supports your data store(s) and file format(s). Refer to <<supported-stores-formats,Supported data stores and file formats>>.

. Create the external table(s) in {connection}. For assistance, refer to the {connection} documentation.

. Create your {connection} connection, if you have not already done so. When selecting tables, select the external tables you want to query, as well as any other tables. Refer to xref:connections-snowflake-add.adoc[].
+
NOTE: Ensure that your external tables are in the same database and schema as the database and schema specified in your {connection} connection.

. xref:search.adoc[Search] the data from your external table.
