If your organization requires that privilege escalation take place through an external tool that integrates with Ansible, and your ThoughtSpot installation is on RHEL, you must manage cluster operations in a certain way. Specifically, you must use Ansible when completing the following tasks:

* xref:rhel-install-ansible.adoc[Creating a cluster]
* xref:rhel-restore-ansible.adoc[Restoring a cluster]
* xref:rhel-start-stop-ansible.adoc#start[Starting a cluster]
* xref:rhel-start-stop-ansible.adoc#stop[Stopping a cluster]
* xref:rhel-upgrade-ansible.adoc[Upgrading a cluster]
