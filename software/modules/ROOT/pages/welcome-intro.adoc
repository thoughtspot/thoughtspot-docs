You can install ThoughtSpot on a cloud provider, VMware, or on a hardware appliance.

All ThoughtSpot nodes need to be on the same platform and same subnet with no connectivity blocked between any two nodes.
You can have multiple clusters on multiple platforms, but you cannot host one cluster on multiple platforms.
