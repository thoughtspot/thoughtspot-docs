ThoughtSpot sometimes deprecates and then de-supports existing features, replacing them with new and more effective means to use our products.
In this article, we give you advance notice of features we are discontinuing in future releases.

Please https://community.thoughtspot.com/customers/s/contactsupport[contact^] your Customer Success or SRE team for clarification.

ThoughtSpot _deprecates_ some existing features, and then _de-supports_ them. These terms mean two different things.

Deprecated::
A deprecated feature still exists in the product, for backward compatibility, but there is a plan to remove it in a later release. Deprecated features do not receive ongoing support from ThoughtSpot.
+
We recommend that you stop using deprecated features as soon as possible, and change your workflows to use the new, improved functionality instead.

De-supported::
A de-supported feature no longer exists in the product. When you upgrade to a newer release, any workflows that rely on a de-supported feature no longer work.

[#de-support-8-0]
== De-supported in 8.0
Pinboard follow::
In 7.2.1 and earlier, there are two different ways for a user to ask ThoughtSpot to email them a Pinboard PDF on a specified schedule.
Users can follow the Pinboard, or xref:pinboard-schedule.adoc[schedule a Pinboard job].
+
In 8.0 and later releases, ThoughtSpot will combine these features into a single action called "Schedule." The *Follow* option will not be available.
This change will allow any user to schedule their own Pinboard emails.
To send Pinboard emails to other users, you still need the xref:privileges-end-user.adoc#schedule-pinboards[*Can schedule for others* permission].
+
ThoughtSpot will migrate any existing Pinboard follows to Pinboard schedules.
If you followed a Pinboard in releases earlier than 8.0, you will see it in the list of Pinboard schedules for that Pinboard as _Migrated from follow (your display name)_.

[#deprecated-8-4-0-sw]
== Deprecated in 8.4.0.sw
The 8.4.0.sw release of ThoughtSpot Software, targeted for May 2022 (LA) and August 2022 (GA), will *deprecate* the following features. ThoughtSpot will drop support for these features in a later release.

If you have the new Pinboard experience turned on in 8.4.0.sw, *Share a Pinboard visualization* is *de-supported* in 8.0. To use this feature, turn the new Pinboard experience off.

Share a Pinboard visualization::
This feature allowed users to share a specific visualization within a Pinboard. The sharing notification contained a direct link to that visualization.
+
In the new Pinboard experience, you can access a direct link to a visualization in a Pinboard from the *more options menu* image:icon-more-10px.png[more options menu icon] for the visualization. Copy the link, share the Pinboard, and send the link to other ThoughtSpot users.

If you have the new answer experience turned on in 8.4.0.sw, these features are *de-supported* in 8.4.0.sw. To use these features, turn the new answer experience off.

Multiple join path resolution within the formula editor or a search::
When you try to search on columns with more than one possible join path, the system no longer allows you to define the join path within the search. Similarly, when you try to create a formula with columns with more than one possible join path, the system does not allow you to define the join path. Instead, the system now prompts you to resolve this issue and avoid confusion or incorrect data by creating a Worksheet with the correct join path.
Send feedback::
The option to send product feedback, from the more options menu image:icon-more-10px.png[more options menu icon] on an Answer or search.
Client-side summaries for tables::
We consolidated column summaries and headlines into one summary, called a headline summary. To calculate these headline summaries, ThoughtSpot executes a query against the underlying database. If you are connecting to your data in an external database, ThoughtSpot executes one query for each summary. If you store your data in ThoughtSpotâ€™s in-memory database, ThoughtSpot executes one query for all summaries in the search. These headline summaries are integrated with the table columns. You can pin them to Pinboards.
R integration::
R integration is not available in the new answer experience at this time. We plan to add support for R in the new answer experience in a future release.
+
ThoughtSpot continues to support R for all customers who currently include R charts in their solutions on the ThoughtSpot Software deployments; please continue to use the classic answer experience.
+
TIP: We support R only in Falcon deployments (data imported into ThoughtSpot), and R integration is disabled by default. It is not available when creating connections and linking to external databases in real time.

[#de-support-7-2-1]
== De-supported in 7.2.1
The 7.2.1 release of ThoughtSpot Software, targeted for April 2022 (GA), will drop support for *Self-Service Upgrade (SSU)*. This feature allowed customers to upgrade their environment to a new ThoughtSpot release themselves, from the UI.

Additionally, the 7.2.1 release will drop support for the *Available Updates* section of the *Upgrade* page in the Admin Console. The *Available Updates* section contained information about available releases customers could upgrade to.

*Self-Service Upgrade* and *Available Updates* both appeared on the *Upgrade* page in the Admin Console. This page will not be available, starting in release 7.2.1.

As an alternative, xref:support-contact.adoc[contact ThoughtSpot Support] to upgrade your Software environment when necessary, or consider ThoughtSpot's Software as a Service offering, https://cloud-docs.thoughtspot.com[ThoughtSpot Cloud^], which upgrades to the latest Cloud release automatically.

[#de-support-7-1-1]
== De-supported in 7.1.1

The 7.1.1 release of ThoughtSpot Software, targeted for November 2021 (GA), will drop support for the following feature.

Ask an Expert::
This feature allowed users to ask a designated expert on a particular data source for help when they run into an issue with an Answer or search they created on that data source. Starting in 7.0.1, users can learn about specific data sources in a different way, by completing xref:search-assist.adoc[Search Assist] sample queries on their own data sources.

[#de-support-7-1]
== De-supported in 7.1

The 7.1 release of ThoughtSpot Software, targeted for July 2021 (LA) and Oct 2021 (GA), will drop support for the following features.

Instant Insights::
Our automated insights strategy is progressively more focused and prioritized around Monitor, where users get _personalized_ insights in the metrics that are important to them, instead of Instant Insights. Prior to 7.1, the Instant Insights feature worked only in on-prem deployments that use our internal database, Falcon. Connections and cloud deployments never supported Instant Insights.
+
Prior to 7.1, Instant Insights appeared in four (4) areas of our product:
+
--
- Home Page: Did you know
- Search: under the answer
- Pinboard: Pinboard Insights at the top of the pinboard
- Worksheet and Table: the Spotiq Insights tab
--

Learn how to use ThoughtSpot Pinboard::
This Pinboard contained search replays created in the system. The Replay Search feature is also de-supported in 7.1. Customers currently use *Replay search* and the *Learn how to use ThoughtSpot Pinboard* to learn how to use ThoughtSpot's search on data. As an alternative, starting in 7.0.1, use xref:search-assist.adoc[Search Assist] to learn how to use ThoughtSpot search on xref:search-assist-coach.adoc[your company's data].

Replay search::
This feature allowed you to replay the search used to create an Answer. As an alternative, starting in 7.0.1, use xref:search-assist.adoc[Search Assist] to learn how to use ThoughtSpot search on xref:search-assist-coach.adoc[your company's data].

[#de-support-7-0]
== De-supported in 7.0

The 7.0 release of ThoughtSpot Software, targeted for March 2021 (LA) and June 2021 (GA), will drop support for  *SearchIQ*. This feature was always in Beta, and was never deployed on production environments.

As we move to ThoughtSpot Cloud, we incorporate and further enrich the affordances of SearchIQ in Ask Answers features, and in an enhanced experience with our Home page.
