ThoughtSpot sometimes deprecates and then removes existing features, replacing them with new and more effective means to use our products.
In this article, we give you advance notice of features we are discontinuing in future releases.

Please https://community.thoughtspot.com/customers/s/contactsupport[contact^] your Customer Success or SRE team for clarification.

ThoughtSpot _deprecates_ some existing features, and then _removes_ them. These terms mean two different things.

Deprecated::
A deprecated feature still exists in the product, for backward compatibility, but there is a plan to remove it in a later release. Deprecated features do not receive ongoing support from ThoughtSpot.
+
We recommend that you stop using deprecated features as soon as possible, and change your workflows to use the new, improved functionality instead.

Removed::
A removed feature no longer exists in the product. When you upgrade to a newer release, any workflows that rely on a removed feature no longer work.

[#remove-7-0]
== Removed in 7.0

The 7.0 release of ThoughtSpot Software, targeted for March 2021 (LA) and June 2021 (GA), will drop support for  *SearchIQ*. This feature was always in Beta, and was never deployed on production environments.

As we move to ThoughtSpot Cloud, we incorporate and further enrich the affordances of SearchIQ in Ask Answers features, and in an enhanced experience with our Home page.

[#remove-7-1]
== Removed in 7.1

The 7.1 release of ThoughtSpot Software, targeted for July 2021 (LA) and Oct 2021 (GA), will drop support for *Instant Insights*.

Our automated insights strategy is progressively more focused and prioritized around Monitor, where users get _personalized_ insights in the metrics that are important to them, instead of Instant Insights. Prior to 7.1, the Instant Insights feature worked only in on-prem deployments that use our internal database, Falcon. Connections and cloud deployments never supported Instant Insights.

Prior to the 7.1 release, Instant Insights appear in four (4) areas of our product:

- Home Page: Did you know
- Search: under the answer
- Pinboard: Pinboard Insights at the top of the pinboard
- Worksheet and Table: the Spotiq Insights tab

[#deprecated-7-1-1]
== Deprecated in 7.1.1
The 7.1.1 release of ThoughtSpot Software, targeted for November 2021 (GA), will deprecate the following features. ThoughtSpot will drop support for these features in a later release. If you have the new Answer experience turned on in 7.1.1, these features are removed in 7.1.1. To use these features, turn the new Answer experience off.

Multiple join path resolution within the formula editor or a search::
When you try to search on columns with more than one possible join path, the system no longer allows you to define the join path within the search. Similarly, when you try to create a formula with columns with more than one possible join path, the system does not allow you to define the join path. Instead, the system now prompts you to resolve this issue and avoid confusion or incorrect data by creating a Worksheet with the correct join path.
Send feedback::
The option to send product feedback, from the more options menu image:icon-more-10px.png[more options menu icon] on an Answer or search.
Client-side summaries for tables::
We consolidated client-side column summaries and headlines from the backend into new headline summaries that come from the backend. These headline summaries are integrated with the table columns. You can pin them to Pinboards.
R integration::
R integration is not available in the new Answer experience at this time. We plan to add support for R in the new Answer experience in a future release.
+
ThoughtSpot continues to support R for all customers who currently include R charts in their solutions on the ThoughtSpot Software deployments; please continue to use the classic Answer experience.
+
[TIP]
====
We support R only in Falcon deployments (data imported into ThoughtSpot), and R integration is disabled by default. It is not available when creating connections and linking to external databases in real time.
