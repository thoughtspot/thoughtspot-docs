ThoughtSpot sometimes deprecates and then removes existing features, replacing them with new and more effective means to use our products.
In this article, we give you advance notice of features we are discontinuing in future releases.

Please https://community.thoughtspot.com/customers/s/contactsupport[contact^] your Customer Success or SRE team for clarification.

ThoughtSpot _deprecates_ some existing features, and then _removes_ them. These terms mean two different things.

Deprecated::
A deprecated feature still exists in the product, for backward compatibility, but there is a plan to remove it in a later release. Deprecated features do not receive ongoing support from ThoughtSpot.
+
We recommend that you stop using deprecated features as soon as possible, and change your workflows to use the new, improved functionality instead.

Removed::
A removed feature no longer exists in the product. When you upgrade to a newer release, any workflows that rely on a removed feature no longer work.

[#deprecated-8-4-0-sw]
== Deprecated in 8.4.0.sw
The 8.4.0.sw release of ThoughtSpot Software, targeted for May 2022 (LA) and August 2022 (GA) will *deprecate* the following features. ThoughtSpot will drop support for these features in a later release.

If you have the new answer experience turned on in 8.4.0.sw, these features are *removed* in 8.4.0.sw. To use these features, turn the new answer experience off.

Multiple join path resolution within the formula editor or a search::
When you try to search on columns with more than one possible join path, the system no longer allows you to define the join path within the search. Similarly, when you try to create a formula with columns with more than one possible join path, the system does not allow you to define the join path. Instead, the system now prompts you to resolve this issue and avoid confusion or incorrect data by creating a Worksheet with the correct join path.
Send feedback::
The option to send product feedback, from the more options menu image:icon-more-10px.png[more options menu icon] on an Answer or search.
Client-side summaries for tables::
We consolidated column summaries and headlines into one summary, called a headline summary. To calculate these headline summaries, ThoughtSpot executes a query against the underlying database. If you are connecting to your data in an external database, ThoughtSpot executes one query for each summary. If you store your data in ThoughtSpotâ€™s in-memory database, ThoughtSpot executes one query for all summaries in the search. These headline summaries are integrated with the table columns. You can pin them to Pinboards.
R integration::
R integration is not available in the new answer experience at this time. We plan to add support for R in the new answer experience in a future release.
+
ThoughtSpot continues to support R for all customers who currently include R charts in their solutions on the ThoughtSpot Software deployments; please continue to use the classic answer experience.
+
TIP: We support R only in Falcon deployments (data imported into ThoughtSpot), and R integration is disabled by default. It is not available when creating connections and linking to external databases in real time.

[#remove-7-2-1]
== Removed in 7.2.1
The 7.2.1 release of ThoughtSpot Software, targeted for April 2022 (GA), will drop support for *Self-Service Upgrade (SSU)*. This feature allowed customers to upgrade their environment to a new ThoughtSpot release themselves, from the UI.

Additionally, the 7.2.1 release will drop support for the *Available Updates* section of the *Upgrade* page in the Admin Console. The *Available Updates* section contained information about available releases customers could upgrade to.

*Self-Service Upgrade* and *Available Updates* both appeared on the *Upgrade* page in the Admin Console. This page will not be available, starting in release 7.2.1.

As an alternative, xref:support-contact.adoc[contact ThoughtSpot Support] to upgrade your Software environment when necessary, or consider ThoughtSpot's Software as a Service offering, https://cloud-docs.thoughtspot.com[ThoughtSpot Cloud^], which upgrades to the latest Cloud release automatically.

[#remove-7-1-1]
== Removed in 7.1.1

Ask an Expert::
This feature allowed users to ask a designated expert on a particular data source for help when they run into an issue with an Answer or search they created on that data source. Starting in 7.0.1, users can learn about specific data sources in a different way, by completing xref:search-assist.adoc[Search Assist] sample queries on their own data sources.

[#remove-7-1]
== Removed in 7.1

The 7.1 release of ThoughtSpot Software, targeted for July 2021 (LA) and Oct 2021 (GA), will drop support for the following features.

Instant Insights::

+
Prior to 7.1, Instant Insights appeared in four (4) areas of our product:
+
--
- Home Page: Did you know
- Search: under the answer
- Pinboard: Pinboard Insights at the top of the pinboard
- Worksheet and Table: the Spotiq Insights tab
--


Learn how to use ThoughtSpot Pinboard::
This Pinboard contains search replays created in the system. The Replay Search feature is also removed in 7.1. Customers currently use *Replay search* and the *Learn how to use ThoughtSpot Pinboard* to learn how to use ThoughtSpot's search on data. As an alternative, starting in 7.0.1, use xref:search-assist.adoc[Search Assist] to learn how to use ThoughtSpot search on xref:search-assist-coach.adoc[your company's data].

Replay search::
This feature allowed you to replay the search used to create an Answer. As an alternative, starting in 7.0.1, use xref:search-assist.adoc[Search Assist] to learn how to use ThoughtSpot search on xref:search-assist-coach.adoc[your company's data].

Custom actions::
Starting in the 7.1.0 software release, embed customers can no longer use custom actions created in the *Action customization* section of the Admin Console, or create new custom actions in the Admin Console.
+
Instead, starting in the 8.4.0.sw release, if you are embedding through https://developers.thoughtspot.com/[ThoughtSpot Everywhere^], you can create new custom actions in the Develop tab. Refer to https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/?pageid=customize-actions#_custom_actions_page[Custom actions overview^].
