:last_updated: 1/30/2020

Learn how to modify a Synapse connection and its tables.

You can modify an Embrace Synapse connection in the following ways:

* Edit a connection: to add or remove tables and columns
* Remap a connection: to map a table or column to a different table or column
* Delete a table
* Delete a connection

== Editing a Synapse connection

You can edit a Synapse connection to add tables and columns.

To edit a connection:

. Click *Data* in the top navigation bar.
. Click the *Connections* tab at the top of the page.
. Click the name of the connection you want to edit.

To remove a table from a connection, delete it from the connection details page.
For more information, see xref:deleting-a-table-from-a-synapse-connection[Deleting a table].

== Remapping a Synapse connection

Modify the connection parameters by editing the source mapping `yaml` file that was created when you added the connection.
For example, you can remap the existing table or column to a different table or column in an existing database connection.
ThoughtSpot recommends that you check the dependencies before and after you remap a table or column in a connection to ensure they display as intended.

To remap a connection:

. Click *Data* in the top navigation bar.
. Click the *Connections* tab at the top of the page.
. Click the name of the connection you want to remap.
+

+

== Deleting a table from a Synapse connection

ThoughtSpot checks for dependencies whenever you try to remove a table in a connection.
ThoughtSpot shows a list of dependent objects, and you can click them to delete them or remove the dependency.
Then you can remove the table.

To delete a table:

. Click *Data* in the top navigation bar.
. Click the *Connections* tab at the top of the page.
. Click the name of the connection that contains the table you want to delete.
+

. Find the table you want to delete in the list, and check the box next to its name.
. Click *Delete*, and then click *Delete* again to confirm.
+

+
If you attempt to delete a table with dependent objects, the operation is blocked.
A _Cannot delete_ window appears, with a list of links to dependent objects.
See xref:deleting-a-table-with-dependent-objects[Deleting a table with dependent objects].

=== Deleting a table with dependent objects

* In the _Cannot delete_ window, click the link for each object to modify or delete it.
+
When all dependencies are removed, you can delete the table.
+

You can also click the name of a table and then click the linked objects to see a list of dependent objects with links.
The list shows the names of the dependent objects (Worksheets, Pinboards or Answers), and the columns they use from that table.
You can use this information to determine the impact of changing the structure of the data source or to see how widely used it is.
Click a dependent object to modify or delete it.

== Deleting a Synapse connection

A connection can be used in multiple data sources or visualizations.
Because of this, you must delete all of the sources and tasks that use that connection, before you can delete the connection.

To delete a connection:

. Click *Data* in the top navigation bar.
. Click the *Connections* tab at the top of the page.
. Check the box next to the connection you want to delete.
. Click *Delete*, and then click *Delete* again to confirm.

If you attempt to delete a connection with dependent objects, the operation is blocked, and a "Cannot delete" warning appears with a list of dependent objects with links.
+

. If the "Cannot delete" warning appears, click the link for each object to delete it, and then click *Ok*.
Otherwise, go to the next step.
. When all its dependencies are removed, delete the connection by clicking *Delete*, and then click again *Delete* to confirm.
