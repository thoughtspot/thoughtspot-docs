Learn how to use the cluster create command to install your appliance.

[#using-cluster-create]
== Using the tscli cluster create command

To install your appliance, you must install the cluster using the release tarball (estimated time 1 hour).

. *Download the release tarball*
+
Download the release tarball from the download link sent by ThoughtSpot Support.
+
Refer to your welcome letter to find a link to download the release tarball.
If you do not have a download link, open a support ticket with xref:support-contact.adoc[ThoughtSpot Support] to access the release tarball.
. *Copy the release tarball*
+
In your Terminal (Apple) or using https://winscp.net/eng/index.php[Winscp] (Windows application), copy the downloaded release tarball to `/home/admin/` and run the cluster installer as shown below.
+
Run the secure copy command:
+
[source]
----
scp <release-number> admin@<hostname>:/home/admin/<file-name>
----
+
For example:
+
[source]
----
$ scp 6.0.tar.gz admin@ThoughtSpot:/home/admin/TS-tarball
----
+
ThoughtSpot recommends that you start the session using https://linux.die.net/man/1/screen[screen], so you do not lose your progress if you lose your connection at any point.
+
[source]
----
$ scp <release-number> admin@<hostname>:/home/admin/<file-name>
----
Note the following parameters:
+
`release-number`:: The version of ThoughtSpot you have on your cluster, such as `6.0` or `5.3`. `release-number` is of the form `0.0.tar.gz`.
`hostname`:: Your network hostname. Ask your network administrator if you do not know your hostname.
 `file-name`:: is the name of the tarball file on your local machine.

. *Run the `tscli cluster create` command*
+
Run `tscli cluster create <release-number>` in your terminal.
+
If you are using an S3 or GCS bucket for object storage, include the flag `--enable_cloud_storage=s3` or `--enable_cloud_storage=gcs`.
GCS is GCP's object storage, and s3 is AWS's object storage.
+
.s3 example:
+
[source]
----
$ tscli cluster create 6.0.tar.gz --enable_cloud_storage=s3
----
+
.GCS example:
+
[source]
----
$ tscli cluster create 6.0.tar.gz --enable_cloud_storage=gcs
----

. *Specify your installation information*
+
Fill out the cluster name, cluster ID, email alert preferences and the IP's of the nodes at the prompts specified in xref:parameters-cluster-create.adoc[Parameters of the tscli cluster create command].

. *Wait for output*
+
You may need to wait about 15 seconds before you see any output.
The installer is unpacking files and copying them over to the nodes, which can take a few seconds.

Do not edit any part of the installer file except the sections specified in xref:parameters-cluster-create.adoc[Parameters of the tscli cluster create command]. If you delete colons, commas, or other parts of the code, setup may fail.

Refer to xref:parameters-cluster-create.adoc[Parameters of the tscli cluster create command] for further information.
