NOTE: Certain elements of conditional formatting are part of the xref:answer-experience-new.adoc[new answer experience]. The new answer experience is in [.label.label-beta]#Beta# and off by default, but the option to turn it on or off individually is on by default. These new elements include conditional formatting for table summaries, improved conditional formatting for attributes and measures in table cells and charts, and conditional formatting for measures in pivot tables. If you have the new answer experience on, your user interface and experience may be different from the experience described in this article. You can turn the new answer experience on or off individually from the *Experience manager* panel in xref:user-profile.adoc#new-answer-experience[your profile]. If that option is not available, contact your administrator.

You can apply conditional formatting to tables or charts to highlight values in the data.
This makes values above, below, or within a particular threshold stand out.

== Understand conditional formatting

Many companies create pinboards with key metrics they want to track in daily or weekly staff meetings.
Using conditional formatting, they can see at a glance how they are performing relative to these metrics.

You can add visual cues for KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) or threshold metrics to charts and tables, to easily show where you are falling short or exceeding targets.
These visual cues are called conditional formatting, which applies color formatting to your search result.
For tables, you can add conditional formatting to set the background color of cells in a table based on the values they contain.
For charts, you can add conditional formatting to show the threshold(s) you defined, and the data that falls within them will be shown using the same color.

[#table]
== Apply conditional formatting to a table

You can use conditional formatting to show table cells with a background color determined by the value they contain. If you are on the new answer experience, pivot tables follow the same conditional formatting rules as tables, even though they fall under ThoughtSpotâ€™s chart category. If you are on the classic experience, you cannot use conditional formatting on pivot tables.

NOTE: You can only apply conditional formatting to numbers and strings. For example, you can apply conditional formatting to a month of year column, with values such as January, but not to a date column where dates are in the format 1 Jan 2021. For pivot tables, you can only apply conditional formatting to measures, not attributes. Conditional formatting for pivot tables is only available in the xref:answer-experience-new.adoc[new answer experience].

To apply conditional formatting to a table:

. In the column header of your table for the column you want to apply formatting to, click the *More* menu icon image:icon-ellipses.png[more options menu icon].

NOTE: If you change to a chart type, you must apply conditional formatting again.
Conditional formatting is tied to the specific visualization.

[#chart]
== Apply conditional formatting to a chart

You can use conditional formatting to show charts with a target value or range drawn as a line in the chart, and the legend colors determined by where values fall relative to the target.

To apply conditional formatting to a chart:

. Click the axis label of your chart.
Select *Conditional Formatting*.
. Click *+ ADD FORMATTING* in the Conditional Formatting window.
. Define the ranges of values and the color to use for each range you want to track.
To add another range, click the *+* icon and repeat.
