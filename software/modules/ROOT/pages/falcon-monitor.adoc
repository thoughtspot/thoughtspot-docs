:description: Use the Falcon Monitor Liveboards for an overview of Falcon and its health, based on query, data load, system stats, and varz metrics.


Use the Falcon Monitor Liveboards for an overview of Falcon, ThoughtSpot's in-memory database, and its health, based on query, data load, system stats, and varz metrics.

include::partial$liveboards-announcement.adoc[]


In ThoughtSpot release 6.2, there are 5 new Liveboards, based on Falcon metrics, that are available to system administrators.

Falcon is ThoughtSpot's in-memory database.
Falcon monitoring functionality pushes different kinds of metrics to Falcon system tables every fifteen minutes.
These system tables, when updated, update the 5 new Liveboards that you can use to monitor Falcon's health.
You can see these Liveboards from the *Liveboards* page, by searching for *360_Overview*:

The 5 new database monitoring Liveboards are: <<falcon_360_overview,Falcon_360_Overview>>, <<falcon_query_360_overview,Falcon_Query_360_Overview>>, <<falcon_dataload_360_overview,Falcon_Dataload_360_Overview>>,  <<falcon_varz_360_overview,Falcon_Varz_360_Overview>>, and <<system_stats_360_overview,System_Stats_360_Overview>>.

You can use these Liveboards for proactive monitoring, or, with help from {support-url}, for debugging.
