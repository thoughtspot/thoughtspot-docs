Use the Falcon Monitor Liveboards for an overview of Falcon, ThoughtSpot's in-memory database, and its health, based on query, data load, system stats, and varz metrics.

In ThoughtSpot release 6.2, there are 5 new Liveboards, based on Falcon metrics, that are available to system administrators.

Falcon is ThoughtSpot's in-memory database.
Falcon monitoring functionality pushes different kinds of metrics to Falcon system tables every fifteen minutes.
These system tables, when updated, update the 5 new Liveboards that you can use to monitor Falcon's health.
You can see these Liveboards from the *Liveboards* page, by searching for *360_Overview*:

The 5 new database monitoring Liveboards are: <<falcon_360_overview,Falcon_360_Overview>>, <<falcon_query_360_overview,Falcon_Query_360_Overview>>, <<falcon_dataload_360_overview,Falcon_Dataload_360_Overview>>,  <<falcon_varz_360_overview,Falcon_Varz_360_Overview>>, and <<system_stats_360_overview,System_Stats_360_Overview>>.

You can use these Liveboards for proactive monitoring, or, with help from xref:support-contact.adoc[ThoughtSpot Support], for debugging.
