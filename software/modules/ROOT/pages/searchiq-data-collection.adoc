SearchIQ collects data to improve its interpretation of natural language search.

Here are some FAQs (frequently asked questions) about data collection in SearchIQ:

*Why does SearchIQ collect data?*

SearchIQ collects data to improve the accuracy of the Natural Language engine in ThoughtSpot.
By learning from the  ways in which users express queries, we continuously improve our system.

NOTE: The Web Speech API provided by the user's browser converts the voice input to text.
Each browser implements the Web Speech API differently, so please check the documentation for your browser if you want more information about voice to text.

*What data does SearchIQ collect?*

SearchIQ collects the search query, how it was interpreted by the system, any user interactions with the search result along with the global unique identifier (GUID) for that user.
The content of the answer returned by SearchIQ is NOT logged.

SearchIQ does not collect or use voice data.

*What are some examples of data SearchIQ collects?*

Let's say there is a retail sales worksheet titled RETAIL SALES WORKSHEET, and a user asks the following question using natural language:

"`Tell me sales for Nike jackets in 2018`"

ThoughtSpot will collect and store the following data:

* The name of the data source on which question was asked (worksheet or tablet, etc): RETAIL SALES WORKSHEET
* The natural language question "`Tell me sales for Nike jackets in 2018`".
* How the question was interpreted:
+
"`tell me`" \-> -- ,
+
"`sales`" \-> "`REVENUE`",
+
"`nike jackets`" \-> '`nike jacket sku 3445`' in PRODUCT NAME,
+
"`in`" \-> --, "`2018`" \-> '`2018`' in SALE DATE.
+
Here, "`tell me`", "`for`" and "`in`" were ignored, "`sales`" was interpreted as the column name "`REVENUE`", "`nike jackets`" was interpreted as a specific nike jacket in the PRODUCT NAME column, and "`2018`" was interpreted as a filter on the SALE DATE column.

* The GUID (global unique identifier) of the user

SearchIQ will NOT log the content of the returned answer - i.e.
the sale number returned for this question.
