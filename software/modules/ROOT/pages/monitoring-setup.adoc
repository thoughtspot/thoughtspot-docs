To set up monitoring, follow these steps:

. Log in to the Linux shell using SSH.
. Issue the `tscli` command to set up monitoring:
+
[source,bash]
----
tscli monitoring set-config
  --email <email>
  --heartbeat_interval <heartbeat_interval>
  --report_interval <report_interval>
----
+
The parameters are:

`--email <email>`:: Comma-separated list (no spaces) of email addresses where the cluster will send monitoring information.
`--heartbeat_interval <heartbeat_interval>`:: The heartbeat email generation interval in seconds.
+
Must be greater than 0.
`--report_interval <report_interval>`:: Sets the cluster report email generation interval in seconds.
+
Must be greater than 0.

. To view your settings and verify that they have been applied, issue:
+
[source,bash]
----
 tscli monitoring show-config
----
+
You should see information like:
+
[source,bash]
----
 Monitoring Configuration:
   Alert Email: dev-alerts@thoughtspot.com
   Heartbeat Interval: 900 sec
   Report Interval: 21600 sec
----

. After the heartbeat interval has passed, check your email to verify that emails are being delivered.
. If you don't receive any emails, xref:relay-host.adoc#verify-email[verify that email is working].
