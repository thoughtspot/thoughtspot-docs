NOTE: All documentation for embedding ThoughtSpot software features and components is now available in the ThoughtSpot UI. To view the documentation, go to the *Develop* tab and click **Guides**.

Developer users embed ThoughtSpot content in their application, web page, portal, or business solution by using ThoughtSpot SDK and APIs.

Customers embedding ThoughtSpot in software releases should continue embedding ThoughtSpot using xref:embedding-overview.adoc[legacy embedding tools], which remain supported in 7.x software releases. Upgrading an environment with an existing embedded solution leveraging the legacy embedded technology to SW v.7.x is supported and seamless from an embedding standpoint.
