Run ThoughtSpot on your own internally managed RedHat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7.8 or 7.9 image, or on an Oracle Enterprise Linux (OEL) 7.9 image.

You have the flexibility to run ThoughtSpot on an RHEL 7.8 or 7.9 image or an OEL 7.9 image that your organization manages internally. This enables your organization to manage the OS and perform SysAdmin tasks.

ThoughtSpot certifies RHEL 7.8 and 7.9 on the following platforms:

* Bare metal deployments on the two ThoughtSpot-certified hardware appliances: xref:dell.adoc[DELL] and xref:smc.adoc[SMC]
* Cloud deployments: xref:aws-configuration-options.adoc[Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2], xref:azure-configuration-options.adoc[Microsoft Azure], and xref:gcp-configuration-options.adoc[Google Cloud Platform (GCP)]
* xref:vmware.adoc[VMware]

ThoughtSpot certifies OEL 7.9 on the following platforms:

* Cloud deployments: xref:aws-configuration-options.adoc[Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2] and xref:gcp-configuration-options.adoc[Google Cloud Platform (GCP)]
* xref:vmware.adoc[VMware]

NOTE: ThoughtSpot does *_not_* certify OEL on Microsoft Azure, SMC, or Dell.
