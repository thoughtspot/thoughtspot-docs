= Edit the SearchIQ mappings
:last_updated: 9/23/2019

In SearchIQ, you can change the language mappings established earlier, during initial configuration.

NOTE: SearchIQ is in [.label.label-beta]#Beta#

* SearchIQ is only available in English.
* SearchIQ is [.label.label-beta]#Beta#, and off by default;
to enable it, contact xref:contact.adoc[ThoughtSpot Support].
* You must have the *Can use experimental features* permission.

When a user types a term in the SearchIQ search bar, SearchIQ interprets what the user means through language mappings.
Users can teach their language to SearchIQ using xref:teach-searchiq.adoc[Teach SearchIQ your language].

As an administrator, you can see and change these language mappings by editing the mappings file.
You can download the mappings file there from menu:Data[Settings > Language Mappings].
This allows you to view and edit all the language mappings users made, in bulk.

== Overview of the mapping process

The language mappings in SearchIQ are controlled by a CSV (comma separated values) file called the mapping file.
The mapping file is saved with an .xls file extension, so you can open and edit it using Excel.
To make these changes you will download the mapping file, change the mappings, and upload your changes back into the system.

In each row of the mapping file, you will see a natural language search term, that is mapped to a search keyword, or something that occurs in the data (like a column name or value).
You can use the mapping file to remove mappings that have been made in error.
Remember these important guidelines when editing the Mappings file:

* Do not delete rows from the file.
Instead, type "True" in the *Delete Y/N* column for any mapping you want to delete.
* Make sure to keep the file in the same format as it had when you downloaded it.

The model file contains a row for each natural language mapping a user has created using the Teach feature of SearchIQ.
It isn't unusual to have tens of thousand of rows in this file.

== Download the mapping file

Before you can make changes to the mapping file, you need to download it.
Then, you edit it using Microsoft Excel, vi/vim, or a similar text editing tool.

To obtain the model file:

. Log in to ThoughtSpot from a browser as an Administrator user.
. Click *Data* in the top navigation bar.
. Click *Settings*, then click *Language Mappings*.
. Click *Download*.

== Edit the file and change the settings

You can delete any of the mappings in the file.
To delete a mapping:

. Open the model file you downloaded (`mappings.xls`) in Excel, vi/vim, or a text editor.

Click `YES` to proceed.

. Find the row for which you want to delete the mapping.
. Find the *Delete Y/N* column.

If you are using Excel, you will see a message similar to this one.

+
The mapping file must be saved as UTF-8 encoded.
If your mapping file includes  multi-byte characters, edit the file using vi or vim to ensure the file is  saved in the correct format.
Otherwise, you won't be able to upload it after  making your edits.

== Upload the edited file

After you have made changes to the mapping file, you must upload it back to ThoughtSpot before the changes will take effect.
To upload the mapping file:

. Log in to ThoughtSpot from a browser as an Administrator user.
. Click *Data*, on the top navigation bar.
. Click *Settings*, then click *Language Mappings*.
. Click *Browse your files* to upload the mappings.xls file, or drag and drop it in the zone.
+
If you receive an error message upon uploading the file, check that it does  not include any multi-byte characters (for example, Japanese or other multi-byte  language characters).
If it does, you must save it as UTF-8 encoded.
You may need to download the file again and  make your edits using vi or vim.

As soon as the file is uploaded, your new settings will be reflected within a few minutes.
