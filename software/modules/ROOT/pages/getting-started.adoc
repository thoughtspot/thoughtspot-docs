= Getting started
:last_updated: 1/31/2020

The *Getting Started* sidebar teaches new users about ThoughtSpot with a brief lesson on navigation and several quick videos on ThoughtSpot's main features.

When you sign in to ThoughtSpot, the *Getting Started* sidebar appears on the right edge of the screen.
It looks like this:

// {% include image.html file="gettingstarted-main.png" title="The Getting Started sidebar" alt="The Getting Started sidebar is on the right edge of the screen." caption="The Getting Started sidebar" %}

[#change-language]
== Change the language

You can change the language that *Getting Started* uses.
ThoughtSpot supports three languages for *Getting Started*: English, Deutsch, and 日本語.

To change the language, open the *Getting Started* menu and click on the language drop-down menu at the top right of the *Getting Started* menu:

// {% include image.html file="gettingstarted-changelanguage.png" title="Change the Getting Started language" alt="Change the language at the top right of the Getting Started menu." caption="Change the Getting Started language" %}

When you change the language, the title of the *Getting Started* sidebar changes.

// {% include image.html file="gettingstarted-sidebardeutsch.png" title="Getting Started Sidebar in Deutsch" alt="The title of the Getting Started sidebar changes to Deutsch." caption="Getting Started Sidebar in Deutsch" %}

It also changes the language of the *back* and *next* buttons.
It does not change the text of the lessons.

[#hide-getting-started-menu]
== Hide the Getting Started menu

After you go through the navigation overview and watch the short videos, you may want to hide the *Getting Started* sidebar.

*Hide Getting Started Menu* shows you how to hide the Getting Started sidebar for an individual user.
If you want to hide it for your whole company, contact xref:contact.adoc[ThoughtSpot Support].

// {% include image.html file="gettingstarted-hide.png" title="Hide the Getting Started menu" alt="Hide the Getting Started Menu from the help menu." caption="Hide the Getting Started menu" %}

// {% include image.html file="getting-started-hideandshow.gif" title="Hide and show Getting Started" alt="Click the Help icon and select Hide getting started." caption="Hide and show Getting Started" %}

You can always activate *Getting Started* again.
To show the Getting Started sidebar, click the *Help* icon image:icon-help-10px.png[icon] and select *Show getting started*.

== Learning resources

Click on the *Getting Started* sidebar to expand it and see the *Learning Resources* available to you.
*Getting Started* contains information for new users on ThoughtSpot's main features, such as *Answers* and *Pinboards*.
It also includes a *Navigation Overview*, which walks you through the options on ThoughtSpot's top menu bar.
