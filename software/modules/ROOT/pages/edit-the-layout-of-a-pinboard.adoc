:last_updated: tbd

Editing the layout of a Pinboard lets you snap visualizations into place, choose between set visualization sizes, and reset your layout.

Visualizations within a Pinboard are easy to move around and snap into place on a relative flow layout.
Your Pinboard layout is also responsive to your browser resolution.
This helps keep the layout of your Pinboard neat and organized.

== Reorder the visualization

In addition, the size picker at the bottom of a visualization's *More* menu image:icon-more-10px.png[more options menu icon] lets you toggle between predetermined sizes for each visualization.
Charts and graphs can be toggled between a small, medium, and full width size, while headlines can be only one size (small).
One row of the Pinboard can hold a predetermined number of visualizations of each size.
