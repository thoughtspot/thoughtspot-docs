Use ThoughtSpot Modeling Language to modify a worksheet, view, table, Liveboard, SpotIQ result, or Answer in a flat-file format. Then you can migrate the object to a different cluster, or restore it to the same cluster.

To work with TML files for <<syntax-worksheets,worksheets>>, <<syntax-views,views>>, <<syntax-sql-views,SQL views>>, <<syntax-tables,tables>>, <<syntax-answers,answers>>, <<syntax-liveboards,SpotIQ results>>, and <<syntax-liveboards,Liveboards>> in ThoughtSpot, you can download these objects to a flat file in `.TML` format, modify it, and subsequently upload this file either to the same cluster, or to a different cluster.
To learn how to export, change, and update Worksheets, Views, Tables, Answers, SpotIQ results, and Liveboards, see xref:scriptability.adoc[Import and export TML files].

In this article, you learn the syntax of the TML files for each object. You also learn how to <<syntax-joins,add and modify joins>> for worksheets, views, SQL views, and tables.

NOTE: The syntax examples in this article contain every possible parameter in a TML file. Some of these parameters are not in a TML file by default. If you want to use them, you must add them yourself. For example, the <<fqn,fqn>> parameter is not present in the TML file by default, but you can add it to differentiate a table from another table with the same name.

== Limitations of working with TML files

There are certain limitations to the changes you can apply by editing a worksheet, answer, table, view, Liveboard, or SpotIQ result through TML.
