To change the colors used in a chart, use the *Customize* menu to dive into the chip for the column or value you would like to change.
You can set colors for:

* bars, lines, areas, bubbles, maps, and other visuals on charts
* slice with color
* legends on charts
* tables for conditional formatting

You can also xref:search-conditional-formatting.adoc[apply a conditional format] to change the color, based on specified criteria.
This type of conditional formatting does not work with Line charts.

Colors are maintained across searches within a session.
For example, when doing a search on `revenue by state`, each state will keep the color assigned to it even if you change the search or chart type.

[#legend]
== Set colors from the legend

When you *slice with color*, or when you have more than one column on an axis, a legend appears next to or below your chart.
The legend tells you the value each color in your chart stands for.
You can change the colors in your chart directly from the legend.
Simply click on the color circle next to a legend item, and click on a different color, or input a HEX value.

Note that you must click on the color circle *_next to_* the legend item to change the color.
If you click on the legend item itself, you temporarily xref:chart-column-visibility.adoc[hide it from the visualization].
