:jira: SCAL-71323


The TS:BI Server system worksheet contains data related to how users interact with various systems in ThoughtSpot. This includes database latency, browser clients, size of responses, and more. The TS Stats: Latency Visualizations system Liveboard uses data from the TS:BI Server worksheet to display average and maximum latency for your visualizations. You can filter by a specific visualization ID on the Liveboard to find specific latency information.

Reference the following table to learn more about the most commonly used columns in the TS:BI Server worksheet:

[options="header"]

| Join Count | Number of joins in the search query.

| Measure Count | Number of measures in the search query.

//| Postgres Latency (us) | Time in microseconds spent in relational database management system software (rdbms) query execution.


| Response Size | Size of response to user’s request in ThoughtSpot in bytes.

| Latency (us) | Response time in microseconds. Round trip latency in microseconds. This is the amount of time between firing the query and returning data to the front end.

| Browser Type | Browser type associated with the request.

| Browser Version | Browser version associated with the request.

| Viz Id | ID of visualization. Can be retrieved from URL parameters of the visualization.

| Client Id | Client ID used to uniquely identify clients

| Client Type | Describes the access mode of ThoughtSpot: either the classic Answer experience, new Answer experience, accessed via Mobile, or accessed via Embedded SDK.

| User Action  a| User actions in ThoughtSpot. For more information, see xref:action-codes.adoc[User action code reference].
