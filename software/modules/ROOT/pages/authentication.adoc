:description: ThoughtSpot provides LDAP/AD, SAML, and ThoughtSpot login to authenticate users.

ThoughtSpot provides LDAP/AD, SAML, and ThoughtSpot login to authenticate users.

ThoughtSpot provides three ways to authenticate users: LDAP/AD, SAML, and ThoughtSpot login.
If possible, ThoughtSpot recommends that you use LDAP/AD or SAML.

Determine which authentication method works best for your use case.

Use the following list to help you choose an authentication option.

== SAML

* Use SAML for single sign-on authentication.
* Can redirect from ThoughtSpot to SAML logins.
* Recommended for portal integration.
* Option to sync users and groups if stored in LDAP/AD.

See how to xref:saml.adoc[Configure SAML].

== LDAP/AD

* Configuration.
* Users authenticate against LDAP or AD.
* Option to sync users and groups with ThoughtSpot to manage group membership.

Read about xref:ldap.adoc[LDAP integration].

== ThoughtSpot

See how to xref:user-management.adoc[Create, edit, or delete a user].

* User created and managed in ThoughtSpot.
* xref:user-management.adoc#password[Password strength control]
* No other enterprise password control: expiration, failed logins, and so on.
* Only recommended when SAML and LDAP aren't options.

All users and groups must be known to ThoughtSpot.
If you are using LDAP/AD or SAML and don't create users in ThoughtSpot, a user is created when the user first logs in.
However, this user is assigned to the `All` group and can only see content available for all users.

Groups are the primary way that security is managed.
Groups are not automatically created.
You can create xref:group-management.adoc[groups] and xref:user-management.adoc[users] manually, or you must automate the assignment from a source system.
ThoughtSpot has an assignment script that works with most LDAP / AD stores.
It also has public APIs that you can use to sync users and groups between source systems and your ThoughtSpot appliance.
