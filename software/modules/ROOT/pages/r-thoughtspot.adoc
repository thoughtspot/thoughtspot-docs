Analyze your data with R scripts that ship with ThoughtSpot, and build visualizations and Liveboards based on the analytical insights you obtained. You can also create custom R scripts, and share them with your team.

R is a popular open source programming language for statistical computing, machine learning, and AI.
ThoughtSpot makes R analysis available as a fully integrated feature.

NOTE: We support R [.label.label-dep]#Deprecated 8.4.0.sw [LA]# only in Falcon deployments (data imported into ThoughtSpot), and R integration is disabled by default. It is not available when creating xref:connections.adoc[connections] and linking to external databases in real time.

== Using R in ThoughtSpot

Users with the xref:privileges-end-user.adoc#custom-r[Can invoke custom R analysis privilege] can run R scripts directly on search results.

Analysts and data scientists who are proficient in R can create and share custom scripts.

Users can leverage custom scripts and ThoughtSpot provided scripts, run pre-built R scripts on top of their search results, and share R visualizations as answers and Liveboards.

This article explains how to use R in ThoughtSpot both from an end user and scripting perspective, but is not meant as an R primer.

== Understand R script requirements in ThoughtSpot

ThoughtSpot provides R as a service within a ThoughtSpot cluster.
Permissions are restricted.
This means the R script does not have permission to issue system commands.

The ThoughtSpot cluster has pre-installed the basic R packages.
If your script requires a specific package, you must contact your ThoughtSpot cluster administrator.

ThoughtSpot internally transforms and binds an R script prior to sending it to the cluster's R service.
The system expects each script to have a well-defined structure, following this format:

----
####R SCRIPT####
<Fill script body>
####COLUMN BINDINGS (ONE PER LINE)####
<Fill column bindings here>
----

The scripts contain the column bindings, and the answer results appear as parameters in the R script.
For each `.param` _n_ in R your script, you must provide a corresponding binding.
The following example illustrates an R script in a form suitable for ThoughtSpot:

----
####R SCRIPT####
df <- data.frame(.param0,.param1, ...);
...
write.csv(..., file=#output_file#, ...);
----

Notice that `.param0` refers to the first column in column binding and `.param1` refers to the second.
Should you need a third binding, you would use  `.param2` and so forth.

The output of the script is either PNG (images) or CSV (comma-separated values, such as a table).
This example script uses `\#output_csv#` for an output in a CSV (tabular) format.
Use `\#output_png#` for an output in PNG format.

Presently, error reporting for R scripts in SpotIQ is limited.
You must validate your R script independent of your ThoughtSpot environment.
After you are sure it is free of errors, you can try the script in ThoughtSpot.

== How to access R scripts

Users with R script privileges can click the *R* icon image:r-icon-inline-2.png[R icon] on the toolbar for any search result (answer).

From here, you have options to write a custom script, or load a pre-built or ThoughtSpot provided script.

== Run pre-built R scripts

You don't have to have a background in statistics or be an R programmer to run R analyses in ThoughtSpot.
You can use ThoughtSpot-provided scripts and share the R visualizations with others.

For more on how to run provided scripts, refer to xref:r-scripts-run.adoc[Run pre-built R scripts on answers].

== Write your own R scripts in ThoughtSpot

If you know R, you can write your own custom scripts, share them as templates, test and run them on your data in ThoughtSpot, and build up a shared library of R analyses, scripts, visualizations, and Liveboards.

Start with the topic on how to xref:r-scripts.adoc[Create and share R scripts] to learn more about writing R scripts in ThoughtSpot, including a few particulars on syntax and column bindings.

Also, Antony Chen's blog post on https://www.thoughtspot.com/codex/using-r-analysis-thoughtspot-time-series-forecasting[Using R Analysis in ThoughtSpot for Time Series Forecasting^] is a nice introduction to writing R scripts in ThoughtSpot.
