:description: On the Liveboard schedules page, found in Data > Utilities > View Liveboard schedules, you can create and manage scheduled Liveboards.


On the *Liveboard schedules* page, found in *Data > Utilities > View Liveboard schedules*, you can create and manage scheduled Liveboards. You can create and manage jobs, including xref:liveboard-schedule.adoc[scheduled Liveboards]. With scheduled Liveboards, you can prepare for recurrent meetings and closely monitored metrics.

With scheduled Liveboard email updates, you can analyze your data offline and share Liveboards with your colleagues, including people who may not have a ThoughtSpot account.

Contact {support-url} if scheduled Liveboards isn't enabled on your cluster.

== Scheduling Liveboards

Administrators and users with the *can schedule for others* privilege can schedule and manage Liveboard jobs for other users and groups. Users don't need the *can schedule for others* privilege to schedule and manage Liveboard jobs for themselves. Users must have at least view-only access to the Liveboards they share.

WARNING: ThoughtSpot recommends that you remain conservative when deciding who has the *can schedule for others* privilege in your organization. There are possible security implications when critical information can be shared outside your company.

== Row-level security

Scheduled Liveboards adhere to row-level security rules. If the recipients are users in ThoughtSpot, they can only see data based on their own access to that Liveboard. If the user doesn't have view-only or greater access to the Liveboard, they don't see any data in the email. However, if the recipients aren't ThoughtSpot users, then they have access to the dataset of the Liveboard based on the senderâ€™s permissions.

== Format and layout of scheduled Liveboards

The Liveboard visualizations are attached to the scheduled email as either CSV or PDF files.
Saved configurations such as Liveboard filters are applied to the attachments.
Refer to the <<format-table,Format types table>> to see how the Liveboard data is represented in each file format.

[#disable-csv-pdf]
Note that as of 9.5.0.sw, you can choose to remove the option to attach CSV and PDF files to scheduled Liveboard emails. When the attached files feature is disabled, you will not see the *Type*, *Format*, *Layout*, *Tabs*, *Branding*, or *Footer text* options when scheduling an email. Scheduled Liveboard email recipients will receive an email with a link to the Liveboard, which they will need to sign in to see. To disable attached CSV and PDF files in scheduled Liveboard emails, contact {support-url}.
