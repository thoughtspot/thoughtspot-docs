On the *Liveboard schedules* page, found in *Data > Utilities > View Liveboard schedules*, you can create and manage jobs, including xref:liveboard-schedule.adoc[scheduled Liveboards]. With scheduled Liveboards, you can prepare for recurrent meetings and closely monitored metrics.

With scheduled Liveboard email updates, you can analyze your data offline and share Liveboards with your colleagues, including people who may not have a ThoughtSpot account.

Contact {support-url} if scheduled Liveboards is not enabled on your cluster.

== Scheduling Liveboards

Administrators and users with the *can schedule for others* privilege can schedule and manage Liveboard jobs for other users and groups. Users do not need the *can schedule for others* privilege to schedule and manage Liveboard jobs for themselves. Users must have at least view-only access to the Liveboards they share.

WARNING: ThoughtSpot recommends that you remain conservative when deciding who has the *can schedule for others* privilege in your organization. There are possible security implications when critical information can be shared outside your company.

== Row level security

Scheduled Liveboards adhere to row-level security rules. If the recipients are users in ThoughtSpot, they can only see data based on their own access to that Liveboard. If the user does not have view-only or greater access to the Liveboard, they do not see any data in the email. However, if the recipients are not ThoughtSpot users, then they have access to the dataset of the Liveboard based on the senderâ€™s permissions.

== Format and layout of scheduled Liveboards

The Liveboard visualizations are attached to the scheduled email as either CSV or PDF files.
Saved configurations such as Liveboard filters are applied to the attachments.
Refer to the <<format-table,format types table>> to see how the Liveboard data is represented in each file format.

To specify the layout of the Liveboard in the email, select *Configure layout options*. For more details about the layout options, refer to xref:liveboard-download-pdf.adoc[].
