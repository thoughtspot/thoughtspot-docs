[#invalidate-tokens]
=== Invalidating refresh tokens of a Snowflake connection configured with Snowflake OAuth

If a Snowflake user's refresh token has been invalidated, the user will not be able to access insights from a Snowflake connection, or the connection itself. This can happen for the following reasons:

- Their default role in Snowflake was changed.
- Their token was obtained for a specific role in the connection and was later revoked.

In this case, it is necessary for the administrator or the author of the connection to use the Invalidate Tokens command, which will then allow the user to re-authenticate to regain access to the connection.

This can be done in two ways:

- If the connection is edited, a message appears at the top of the connection screen indicating that the connection has been modified, and that users may have to re-authenticate. An *Invalidate Tokens* link appears next to the message. Selecting that link will allow the user to invalidate tokens.
- The administrator or author of the connection, can use the Invalidate Tokens command in the Snowflake connection.

To invalidate refresh tokens of a Snowflake connection:

. Select *Data* in the top navigation bar.
. Select the *Connections* tab in the left navigation bar.
. Select the name of the Snowflake connection you want to edit.
. Select the more menu image:icon-more-10px.png[more menu icon], and select *Invalidate Tokens*

After running the Invalidate Tokens command, logged-in users of the connection will have to re-authenticate to regain access to the connection.

IMPORTANT: Invalidating tokens for a connection, invalidates the refresh tokens for all users of a connection, except the author.
