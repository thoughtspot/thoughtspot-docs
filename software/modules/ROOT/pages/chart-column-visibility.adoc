:description: Clicking a legend item will hide it from the chart, but does not delete it from your search.

Selecting a legend item will hide it from the chart, but does not delete it from your search. You can select the legend item again to show it.
The legend appears when you have more than one column on an axis, or when you *slice with color*.
To hide and show values:

On the chart, select the legend value you would like to hide.
Select the hidden legend value again to show it.

To exclude an item from a chart, such as a column or a pie wedge, right-click on the item and select *Exclude "value"*.
