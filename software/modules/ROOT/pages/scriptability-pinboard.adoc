= Migrate or restore pinboards
:last_updated: 7/20/2020

You can export an entire ThoughtSpot Pinboard in a flat-file format. After optional modification, you can migrate it to a different cluster, or restore it to the same cluster.

Scriptability for Answers and Pinboards is in [.label.label-beta]#Beta#.
To enable Scriptable Answers and Pinboards, contact ThoughtSpot Support.

In ThoughtSpot, you can download Pinboards to a flat file in `TSL`, xref:tsl-pinboard.adoc[ThoughtSpot's Scripting Language], modify the file, and subsequently upload this file either to the same cluster, or to a different cluster.

This mechanism supports several scenarios that you may encounter:

* *Migrating from a development environment to a production environment* by downloading the file from the development cluster and uploading the same file to the production cluster
* *Implementing metadata changes outside ThoughtSpot UI*, such as replacing the underlying data source for the entire Pinboard, or replacing a single column from one data source with a column in another data source
* *Reusing existing objects to build new objects*, such as building two very similar objects based on a similar, pre-existing object.

== Prerequisites

|===
| Export with dependents | Export without dependents | Import with dependents | Import without dependents

| *View* permission for the Pinboard.
*View* permission on all underlying tables and Worksheets.
For example, if a Pinboard is built on top of a Worksheet that is built on top of a View, you must have *view* permission for all of these objects.
| *View* permission for the Pinboard.
| If you are not overwriting the existing dependents, you must have the *can manage data* permission.
If you are overwriting the existing dependents, you must have the *can manage data* permission, and *edit* permission on the dependents.
| You must have *view* permission for the dependents that the Pinboard directly depends on.
For example, if a Pinboard is built on top of a Worksheet that is built on top of a View, you must have view permission for the Worksheet, not the View.

[#pinboard-export]
== Export Pinboard

You can export <<export-one,one Pinboard at a time>>, or export <<export-zip-file,more than one Pinboard as a zip file>>.
The zip file contains a document called the `Manifest` file, which defines the objects you exported, and their underlying data sources.

To export one Pinboard:

. Navigate to the Pinboard you want to export.
. Click the three-dot icon, and select *Export as .tsl*.

  Refer to xref:tsl-pinboard.adoc[Pinboard TSL specification] for the full syntax of the TSL file.

[#pinboard-update]
== Update a Pinboard

To update an existing Pinboard, you must export the `.tsl` file, make any necessary changes, and then upload it as a new Pinboard.
You cannot overwrite an existing Pinboard.
Instead, you must create a new Pinboard.

. Select *Pinboards* on the top navigation bar.
. Select the *Import* button in the upper-right side of the screen.
