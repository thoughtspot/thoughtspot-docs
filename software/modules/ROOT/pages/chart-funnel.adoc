The funnel chart shows a process with progressively decreasing proportions amounting to 100 percent in total.  A funnel chart is similar to a stacked percent column chart, and is often used to represent stages in a sales process.

You can visualize the progression of data as it passes from one phase to another.
Data in each of these phases is represented as different proportions.
