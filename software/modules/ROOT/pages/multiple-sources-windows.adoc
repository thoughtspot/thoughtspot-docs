You can add multiple ODBC data sources.

Use this procedure if you want to add an additional data source after creating xref:odbc-windows-install.adoc[installing ODBC on Windows].
The main reason for needing to set up multiple ThoughtSpot ODBC data sources is that you have a production cluster and a test or development cluster.

. Locate and open the *ODBC Data Source Administrator (64-bit)* application.

. Select the *System DSN* tab.
. Select *Add*.
+
The system lists the available drivers.
+

. Choose the *ThoughtSpot ODBC Driver* and select *Finish*.
+
The system displays the *Client Configuration Dialog*.
+

. Enter your data source configuration.

|===
| Configuration Property | Value

| *Data Source Name*
| The name you want to call the data source.

| *Description*
| A description of the data source.

| *Server IP*
| A list of the IP addresses for each node, separated by commas.

| *Server Port*
| `12345`

| *Idle Timeout*
| Time in seconds after which an idle ODBC connection times out.

| *Login Timeout*
| Time in seconds after which a login request times out.

| *Query Timeout*

You can find other supported properties in xref:odbc-jdbc-configuration.adoc[ODBC and JDBC configuration properties].

. When you are done, select *OK* to save your new configuration.

. Select *Test Connection* to test your database connection. If your connection is successful, a Success pop-up appears

. Select *Cancel* to close the *DSN Configuration* dialog.
. Select *OK* to close the *Client Configuration Dialog* the dialog.
. Select *OK* to close the *ODBC Data Source Administrator (64-bit)* application
