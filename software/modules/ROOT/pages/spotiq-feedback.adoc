Learn how to rate a SpotIQ insight.

With SpotIQ analysis feedback, you can rate a SpotIQ analysis result, or insight, by clicking the like image:thumb_up.png[more options menu icon] or dislike image:thumb_down.png[more options menu icon] icon of the insight.

When you click dislike, you can provide more details on why you disliked the insight by answering the questions based on the type of insight, decisions made by SpotIQ during analysis, aggregation, and so on.
These questions help determine if the features of an insight are relevant, or too obvious.

ThoughtSpot collects your feedback and applies it to any future SpotIQ analyses you run. If you dislike a specific type of insight, SpotIQ pushes that type of insight to the bottom of any future SpotIQ analyses you run. The feedback you provide is specific to you and does not affect the SpotIQ experience of other users.

////
The following are examples of questions based on different types of insights.

*Anomaly insight:* <br>
