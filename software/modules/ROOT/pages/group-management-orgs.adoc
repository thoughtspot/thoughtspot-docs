:description: ThoughtSpot has powerful user group management for assigning privileges, user selection, multi-tier subgroups, and emailing.



Before adding users, create the groups to which they belong.
Each group includes a set of privileges for its users.

[NOTE]
====
This article contains instructions for managing groups if your company uses the xref:orgs-overview.adoc[Orgs] feature for multi-tenancy in ThoughtSpot. If you have an Org switcher to the left of the help icon in the top navigation bar, your company is using Orgs.

If you do not have an Org switcher between the help icon and the *Search answers and Liveboards* search box, your company is *_not_* using Orgs. Refer to xref:group-management.adoc[].

[#add-group]
== Create a group

To create a group and add privileges for the group, follow these steps:

. Ensure that you are in the correct Org. Navigate to the specific Org the groups you must manage are in. Use the Org Switcher to the left of the help menu in the top navigation bar.
. Navigate to the Admin Console by selecting the *Admin* tab from the top navigation bar.
. Select *Groups* from the left navigation bar that appears. If you do not see *Groups*, you may be in the *All orgs* section of the *Admin Console*. Instead, select *Primary org* from the left navigation bar. Then, select *Groups*.

. Select the *+ Add Group* button on the upper-left side of the screen.
. In the *Add a new group* modal, enter the details for the new group:
+
image::add-group-orgs.png[Enter details for the new group]
+
[#group-name]
Group name::
Enter a unique name for the group.
+
[#display-name]
Display name::
Name of the group as it appears in ThoughtSpot.
+
[#sharing-visibility]
Sharing visibility::
Indicate whether objects can be shared with this group. When set to *SHAREABLE*,
this group is an option in the *Share* dialog for objects within the Org.
+
[#description]
Description::
Optionally, enter a description.
+
[#privileges]
Privileges::
Check the xref:groups-privileges.adoc#list-of-privileges[privileges] you want to grant to the group. If you add the privilege *Can administer Org* to a group, all users in that group can see all the data in the Org. Administrators can always see all data sources in the Org, and xref:security-rls.adoc[row-level security] does not apply to them. To give a group cluster administrator privileges, the group must be in the Primary Org. Any group with the *Can administer Org* privilege in the Primary Org is automatically a cluster administrator.

. You can also add _<<add-groups,groups>>_ (these would be the subgroups of the group you are creating) and  _<<add-users,users>>_.
. Select *Add* to create the group.

[#add-groups]
=== Groups

Follow these steps to assign subgroups to the group:

. Select the *Groups* tab.

[#change-email]
