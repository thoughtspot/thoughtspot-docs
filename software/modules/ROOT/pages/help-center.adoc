There are multiple locations inside and outside the ThoughtSpot application where you can get more help.
This page describes several ways to get more help inside or outside the application interface.

== ThoughtSpot documentation

Each version of ThoughtSpot has its own documentation set.
ThoughtSpot releases new documentation sets for every major release version (`x.y` or `x.y.0.sw`) of ThoughtSpot.
Documentation features added with minor versions (`x.y.z` or `x.y.z.sw`) are added to the corresponding major release.
This means, for example, that new documentation for the 10.1.0.sw.cu1 minor release version appears in the 10.1.0.sw major version documentation.

TIP: ThoughtSpot supplies release notes for every major release and every minor release version (`x.y.z`).

== Information Center

The *Information Center*, ThoughtSpotâ€™s help menu, contains useful information and links to provide you with more help and support. Select the help icon image:icon-help-10px.png[Help icon image] next to your profile in the top navigation bar.

The Information Center opens. It contains the following three sections:

Help:: Search Documentation, Training, and Community articles. Enter the terms you are searching in the search bar, and you can choose from results in support documentation, community articles, and training videos.


Getting Started::

//Tutorials::
//View several longer, more in-depth tutorials on how to use specific aspects of the product. This section contains in-depth videos about joins, worksheets, and formulas.

What's new::
