Each version of ThoughtSpot has its own documentation set.
ThoughtSpot releases new documentation sets for every major release version (`x.y`) of ThoughtSpot.
Documentation features added with minor versions (`x.y.z`) are added to the corresponding major release.
This means, for example, that new documentation for the 6.0.1 minor release version appears in the 6.0 major version documentation.

TIP: ThoughtSpot supplies release notes for every major release and every minor release version (`x.y.z`).
