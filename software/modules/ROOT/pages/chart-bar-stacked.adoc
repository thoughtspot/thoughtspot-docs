:description: The stacked bar chart is similar to the bar chart, but includes a legend which divides each bar into additional sections by color.


The stacked bar chart is similar to the xref:chart-bar.adoc[bar chart], but with one major difference.
It includes a legend, which divides each bar into additional sections by color. Note that you can only use an attribute to slice with color.

Stacked bar charts are typically used when you want to compare aggregated data and the data that it includes together.
You can click on a configurable axis chip (any axis chip with a *>*) to show Detail Labels (summaries for each section of each bar) and Total Labels (show the sum of the stacks for each bar).

You can also plot the x-axis as a percentage, adding up to 100%.
Click on the measure or attribute chip that you are using to *slice with color*.
Under *Format*, toggle *Stack 100%* on or off.
You can also toggle *Stack 100%* from an axis chip, as in the preceding image.
This feature is also available for stacked area and column charts.

Your search must have least two attributes and one measure to be represented as a stacked bar chart.
