Learn how to add a formula to a search.

You can add a formula directly within a search.
Some common reasons for using a formula in a search are to perform mathematical functions, check for and replace null values, or add conditional logic.

To create a formula in a search, follow these steps:

. Start a new search, or choose an existing answer from a pinboard to edit.
. If the answer shows a chart, switch to *Table View*.

NOTE: Formula elements are color coded by type and can include the formula operators and functions (blue), the names of columns (purple), and/or constants (black).

. You can see a list of formula operators with examples by clicking *Formula Assistant.* Expand a category, such as *Operators*, and click on a formula operator for a definition and example.

. If you want to change what your formula returns, use the *Advanced settings*.
Depending on your formula, you may be able to change the following aspects:
 ** *Data type*: Determines the type of data that the formula generates.
For example, use `date` for an `add_days` formula.
 ** *Measure or attribute*: Determines if the output of the formula is a measure or an attribute.
For example, choose `attribute` for a formula that generates age groups, and choose `measure` for a formula that generates profit.
 ** *Aggregation*: Determines the default aggregation of the formula output.
For example, choose `min` to see minimum profit.
