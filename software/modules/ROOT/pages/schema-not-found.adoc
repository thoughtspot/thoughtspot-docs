Correct `schema not found` errors.  When connecting with ODBC, you must specify both the `DATABASE` and `SCHEMA` parameters.
This is true even if you do not use schema names in ThoughtSpot.
If you don't supply a `SCHEMA`, you get an error indicating that the schema could not be found.

The default schema name in ThoughtSpot is `falcon_default_schema`.
To set the `SCHEMA` on Windows, adding a custom property with the key `SCHEMA` and the value `falcon_default_schema`.

On Linux, you can edit the properties in the `odbc.ini` file for the driver you are using:
