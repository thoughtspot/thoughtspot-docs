= Schema not found error with ODBC

Correct schema not found errors.

When connecting with ODBC, you need to specify both the `DATABASE` and `SCHEMA` parameters.
This is true even if you do not use schema names in ThoughtSpot.
If you don't supply a `SCHEMA`, you get an error indicating that the schema could not be found.

The default schema name in ThoughtSpot is `falcon_default_schema`.
To set the `SCHEMA` on Windows, adding a custom property with the key `SCHEMA` and the value `falcon_default_schema`.

On Linux, you can edit the properties in the `odbc.ini` file for the driver you are using:

----
[ThoughtSpot]
Description = ThoughtSpot 64-bit ODBC Driver
Driver = ThoughtSpot
ServerList =  172.18.231.17 12345
Locale = en-US
ErrorMessagesPath = /home/admin/linux/ErrorMessages
UseSsl = 0
#SSLCertFile = # Set the SSL certificate file path. The certificate file can be obtained by extracting the SDK tarball
#LogLevel = 0 # Set log level to enable debug logging
#LogPath = # Set the debug log files path
DATABASE = # Set the default database to connect to
SCHEMA = # Set the default schema to connect to
