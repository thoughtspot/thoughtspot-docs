With SpotIQ comparative analysis, you can compare two data points for complex measures.


SpotIQ comparative analysis compares data points of simple or complex measures using these aggregates:

* _Sum_
* _Count_
* _Sum over sum_, which generate a Pinboard that has 'what-if' percentage insights
* _Average_, which generate a Pinboard that has 'what-if' percentage insights
* Other functions which use a 'versus' analysis to show the absolute change grouped by different drill attributes

. On the top navigation bar, click *SpotIQ*.
. Select the *Analyses* tab.
+
Your analysis may be in progress.
Wait until its *Status* changes to _Done_.
+
Click _View Results_ to open the pinboard.

. In the report, SpotIQ generates a Pinboard with insights that compare the two selected points, grouped by the columns you chose for analysis. Note that each colored section of a SpotIQ insight represents a statistically significant outlier among the values of your chosen columns.

1.&nbsp;Give feedback:: SpotIQ learns how to improve its feedback based on the information you provide. If you dislike a specific type of insight, SpotIQ pushes that type of insight to the bottom of any future SpotIQ analyses you run. The feedback you provide is specific to you and does not affect the SpotIQ experience of other users.
2.&nbsp;Add to a pinboard:: You can add the specific visualization to an existing pinboard, or create a new pinboard and add it there.
3.&nbsp;Analysis details:: Get the name of the algorithm.
4.&nbsp;More options:: You can run another round of SpotIQ analysis, download the data as a CSV file, edit this visualization, or edit a copy of the visualization.

[#advanced-comparative-analysis]
== Advanced Comparative Analysis in SpotIQ

ThoughtSpot ships with a number of comparative algorithms.
Using the *Advanced* option of SpotIQ, you can adjust the parameters of the analysis, or choose a different comparative algorithm for your data.

After selecting the relevant analysis columns, click the *Advanced* tab.

Under *Select Algorithms*, select the name of the algorithm.
You may have several options available, or only a single one.
In this example, the only valid option is *Change Analysis*.

Under *Customize algorithm for comparative analysis*, adjust the options.
In this example, the algorithm parameters are *Max Diff Elements*, *Max Fraction*, *Min Abs Change Ratio*, and *Min Change Ratio*.
