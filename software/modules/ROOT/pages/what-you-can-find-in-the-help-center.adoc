= More help and support
:last_updated: 8/11/2021

There are many locations on the web where you can find help for ThoughtSpot.

There are multiple locations inside and outside the ThoughtSpot application where you can get more help.
This page describes some of the ways to get more help inside or outside of the application interface.

Each version of ThoughtSpot has its own documentation set.
ThoughtSpot releases new documentation sets for every major release version (`x.y`) of ThoughtSpot.
Documentation features added with minor versions (`x.y.z`) are added to the corresponding major release.
This means, for example, that new documentation for the 6.0.1 minor release version appears in the 6.0 major version documentation.

TIP: ThoughtSpot supplies release notes for every major release and every minor release version (`x.y.z`).

== Help menu
