Prepare the VMs before installing your ThoughtSpot cluster(s).

. SSH into a VM.
+
[source,console]
----
$ ssh -i key.pem admin@<VM-IP>
----

. Run `sudo /usr/local/scaligent/bin/prepare_disks.sh` to configure the VMs.
+
WARNING: Make sure you migrate any data off the disks.
This command formats the disks, wiping them clean.
+
[source,console]
----
$ sudo /usr/local/scaligent/bin/prepare_disks.sh
----

. Configure the VM based on your specific network information.
Refer to your site-survey or ask your network administrator for that information.
. Run `df -h` to confirm configuration.
+
[source,console]
----
$ df -h
----

. Repeat these steps for each of your VMs.
+
When complete, your storage is mounted and ready for use with your cluster.

When the setup completes, you can load data into ThoughtSpot for search analytics.
