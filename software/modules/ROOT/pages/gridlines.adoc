= Display gridlines
:last_updated: 2/24/2020

You can display gridlines on charts with X and Y axes.

Charts with X and Y axes can display gridlines.
Y-axis gridlines provide horizontal gridlines, and X-axis gridlines provide vertical gridlines.

To display gridlines, follow these steps:

. While viewing your Answer as a chart, click the *chart configuration* icon image:icon-gear-10px.png[] on the top right.
. Click *Settings* at the bottom of the *Customize* menu.
. Select one or both of the gridline options.

X-axis gridlines are useful when you have a more complicated chart.
For example, if you view a column chart for *sales* by *department* and *store region*, you might want to use gridlines to more easily visualize the column groups.
You might also use gridlines when your chart includes a *time* element.
