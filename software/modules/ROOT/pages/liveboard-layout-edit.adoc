Editing the layout of a Liveboard lets you snap visualizations into place, choose between set visualization sizes, and reset your layout.

Visualizations within a Liveboard are easy to move around and snap into place on a relative flow layout.
Your Liveboard layout is also responsive to your browser resolution.
This helps keep the layout of your Liveboard neat and organized.
