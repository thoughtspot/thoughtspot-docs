Editing the layout of a Liveboard lets you snap visualizations into place and change the visualization size. If you enable the xref:liveboard-experience-new.adoc[new Liveboard experience], you must be in *Edit* mode to edit the Liveboard layout.

Visualizations within a Liveboard are easy to move around and snap into place on a relative flow layout. This helps keep the layout of your Liveboard neat and organized.

In the classic Liveboard experience, your Liveboard layout responds to your browser resolution by adjusting its layout to a one- or two-column view to fit the screen width and orientation of your device. In the new Liveboard experience, your Liveboard layout reacts to your browser width and resolution by generating a horizontal scroll bar at the lower edge of your screen.

== Reorder the visualizations

You can reorder the visualizations in a Liveboard by dragging and dropping them.
One Liveboard row can hold a predetermined number of visualizations of each size. To change the visualization layout, follow these steps:

. Navigate to the Liveboard you would like to edit.
. In the classic Liveboard experience, click on the bar that appears at the top of any visualization when you hover over it. This allows you to drag and drop your visualizations to new positions in the Liveboard. In the new Liveboard experience, you must first select the *Edit* button at the upper right of the Liveboard.

. Select *Save changes*.

== Change the size of a visualization

The size picker at the bottom of a visualization's *More* menu image:icon-more-10px.png[more options menu icon] lets you toggle between predetermined sizes for each visualization. All visualizations *except headlines* have 5 size options. Headlines can only be the smallest size.

If you enable the xref:liveboard-experience-new.adoc[new Liveboard experience], you can customize your Liveboard visualizations to be any size, not just the 5 predetermined sizes in the classic experience.

Refer to the instructions for the <<classic,classic Liveboard experience>> or the <<new,new Liveboard experience>>.
