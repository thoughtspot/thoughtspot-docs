Editing the layout of a Liveboard lets you snap visualizations into place and change the visualization size.

include::partial$liveboard-experience-new-announcement.adoc[]


Visualizations within a Liveboard are easy to move around and snap into place on a relative flow layout. This helps keep the layout of your Liveboard neat and organized.

Your Liveboard layout reacts to your browser width and resolution. If you decrease your browser width or resolution, a horizontal scroll bar appears at the lower edge of your screen.

== Reorder the visualizations

You can reorder the visualizations in a Liveboard by dragging and dropping them in *Edit* mode. To change the visualization layout, follow these steps:

. Navigate to the Liveboard you would like to edit.
. Select the *Edit* button at the upper right of the Liveboard. If this button is grayed out, you do not have edit privileges for the Liveboard. To resolve this, contact your administrator or the creator of the Liveboard.

. Select the bar that appears at the top of any visualization when you hover over it. This allows you to drag and drop your visualizations to new positions in the Liveboard.

. Select the *Edit* button at the upper right of the Liveboard.

. Select the *More* menu image:icon-more-10px.png[more menu icon] for the visualization you would like to move to another tab.

You can customize your Liveboard visualizations to be any size.

All visualizations *except headlines* have 5 predetermined size options, in addition to the custom size option. Headlines only have 1 predetermined size option, in addition to the custom size option.

. Navigate to the Liveboard you would like to edit.
. Select the *Edit* button at the upper right of the Liveboard. If this button is grayed out, you do not have edit privileges for the Liveboard. To resolve this, contact your administrator or the creator of the Liveboard.

== Make a copy of a visualization from your Liveboard

You may see a visualization that you would like to edit or filter, without editing or filtering the Liveboard. To do this, you can *make a copy* of a visualization. The copy you create takes into account the Liveboard filters that apply to the visualization.

To edit a copy of a visualization, follow these steps:

. Navigate to the Liveboard that contains the visualization of which you would like to make a copy.
. In the upper-right corner of the visualization of which you would like to make a copy, select the *More* menu icon image:icon-more-10px.png[more options menu icon].

. Select *Make a copy*.
+
A copy of the answer that created the visualization opens in a new tab, with "Copy of" added to the beginning of the title.

. Make any changes you want to the visualization.
. Click the *More* menu icon image:icon-more-10px.png[more options menu icon] and select *Save*.
+
The Save Answer dialog box appears.

. Change the name and description, as needed, and select *Save Answer*.
+
When you navigate back to the Answers page, your edited answer appears in the list.

== Liveboard tabs

You may want to separate your Liveboard into multiple tabs, grouping certain visualizations together in each tab. For example, you may have a *Sales* Liveboard that contains top-level KPIs and more detailed charts. You can create a tab for the top-level KPIs for executives to view, and a tab for the more detailed charts that managers need to monitor. To add tabs, select the *Edit* button at the upper right of the Liveboard, and select *+ Add tab* in the top menu.

These actions appear under the *More* menu image:icon-more-10px.png[more options icon] for the Liveboard, in *view* or *edit* mode, or under the *More* menu image:icon-more-10px.png[more options icon] for a visualization, in *view* or *edit* mode.
