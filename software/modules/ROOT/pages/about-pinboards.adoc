Create a new Pinboard to group and manage related search results.
Pinboards act like live dashboards.
They are collections of your related charts, tables, and headlines.

== What are Pinboards

You can pin charts and tables to any Pinboard which you created, and those that have been shared with you with the *Edit* privilege.
When you create a Pinboard, you can share it with other people with either the *View* or *Edit* privilege.
Pinboards are interactive, allowing you to perform actions like filtering, excluding values, and drill down on the visualizations.

== Other Pinboard actions

Other Pinboard actions include actions you normally perform on your search as well as actions that you can only perform on a Pinboard.
Most of these actions are found under the *Actions* button.

Other actions are available on a Pinboard display itself.
Some actions always appear, while others appear only when you hover over specific locations of the Pinboard.
This diagram displays active action areas on a Pinboard.
