= Custom SpotIQ analysis
:last_updated: 11/15/2019

Learn how to customize SpotIQ analysis.

Everywhere in ThoughtSpot where you can run *SpotIQ analyze*, you can configure a customized SpotIQ analysis.
The customized analysis can be a one-time customization or can apply to all future analysis of that particular data source.

== Finding customization controls

Every menu or location where you can run *SpotIQ analyze*, you can customize your analysis.
You access it using the lightbulb button image:icon-lightbulb.png[more options menu icon] or the *More* menu image:icon-ellipses.png[SpotIQ analyze icon].

Regardless of where you run *SpotIQ analyze* in ThoughtSpot, the *SpotIQ* window has the same layout.
The columns displayed, though, are specific to the data from which you run *SpotIQ analyze*.

This window has two tabs:

* *Columns*, where you can explicitly indicate which columns to include in a SpotIQ analysis.
(You can select all, some, or none.)
* *Advanced*, where you can run custom analyses and incorporate R scripts into SpotIQ.

The *Advanced* tab has many options.
The panel scrolls, so more algorithms are available than appear in the following image

The *SpotIQ* insights page has an option to open this window to customize a single analysis.

The *Tell us more* window provides information on how to exclude a value from all future analysis.
