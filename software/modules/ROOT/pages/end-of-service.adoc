:description: The timelines of how long ThoughtSpot will provide support for Software releases.

This page provides the end-of-service-life (EOSL) dates for each ThoughtSpot Software release.  After a release version reaches its end-of-service-life date, ThoughtSpot continues to provide documentation for that version, but it no longer provides feature patches for it.
