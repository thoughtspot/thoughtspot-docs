ThoughtSpot Software provides security audit events related to account activities and user actions within ThoughtSpot.
These events can help your SOC team detect potential security threats or compromised user accounts in your organization.

== How to fetch security events

To fetch security events from ThoughtSpot, you can push the logs to your SIEM server.

=== Push to your SIEM server

ThoughtSpotâ€™s human-readable and comprehensive events can be shipped to your SIEM application in near real-time. Security events remain within the system for 30 days.
To integrate with your SIEM or view these logs, contact {support-url}.

ThoughtSpot also supports log ingestion to the customer SIEM system. We support multiple output plugins which can be configured to push the security audit events to the configured destination SIEM server at an interval of every 5 seconds.

ThoughtSpot supports the following output plugin options:

- HTTP
- Splunk
- Azure Log Analytics
- Datadog
