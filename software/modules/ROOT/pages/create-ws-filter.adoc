= Add a filter to a worksheet

You can add filters to a Worksheet to limit the data it contains.
This is useful when you have underlying tables that store more data than is necessary for the types of analyses the Worksheet is intended for.
You can also use Worksheet filters to provide data security, when you want different groups of users to be able to see different data without relying on row level security.

NOTE: Worksheet filters are ignored by the search index.  As a result, when searching a worksheet, you will get suggestions for things even when they are filtered out.  

To add a filter to a Worksheet through the user interface:

. Click *Data* in the top menu bar, find your Worksheet, and click its name.
. Click the *Edit Worksheet* button.
