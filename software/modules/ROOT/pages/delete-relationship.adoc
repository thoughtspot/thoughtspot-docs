You can delete a relationship between tables through the ThoughtSpot application or TQL.

You must have either the xref:about-users-groups.adoc[*Can administrate ThoughtSpot* or the *Can manage data* privilege] to delete a relationship.
If you're not an administrator, you also need edit permissions on the table, view, or worksheet.

If you created a relationship (join or link) between tables using the Web interface, you can also delete it from the Web interface.
But if the relationship was created using TQL, you must also use TQL to delete it.

xref:change-schema.adoc[To delete a relationship using TQL], use an `+ALTER TABLE...DROP CONSTRAINT...+` or `+ALTER TABLE...DROP RELATIONSHIP...+` statement.

To delete a relationship from the Web interface:

. Click *Data* on the top navigation bar.
. Click the name of the data source you from which you want to remove the relationship.
. Click *Joins*.
+
The list of existing joins appears.
+
In a worksheet, you must click *Joins within worksheets* and choose *Joins between worksheets*.
