Answer Explorer provides you with AI-guided exploration of Answers within Pinboards, so you can more easily find valuable and actionable information inside your data.

Answer Explorer, ThoughtSpot's AI-guided exploration of Answers and headline metrics within Pinboards, provides you with valuable suggestions on how to explore and understand your data, based on two main criteria.
The Answer Explorer AI considers both popularity and personalization.
The feature suggests ways to answer questions that are relevant to many other users, and takes your own ThoughtSpot history into account.
Answer Explorer helps you better understand your data and get to actionable insights faster with just a click.

You can access Answer Explorer from any Answer or headline metric in a Pinboard.
Click the *Explore* button that appears when you hover over any Answer or headline.

The Answer expands to fill your screen, and the *Explore this data* menu appears, on the *Filters* screen.

You can explore your data in several different ways, using <<explore-filters,filters>>, <<explore-add,adding>> or <<explore-replace,replacing>> attributes or measures, or <<explore-comparisons,comparing>> attribute values.

Note that when you explore a headline, you can only use Answer Explorer to <<explore-filters,filter>> on it.

Answer Explorer's AI updates its suggestions every time you add something new to your visualization.
If you add a suggested filter, Answer Explorer then suggests new filters, comparisons, and columns to add or replace, based on that new filter in your chart.
For example, in a retail data set, you might choose to add a filter for the *west* region.
Answer Explorer might then suggest you *add* your data's _store state_ column, since you are interested in how your stores perform based on location.
In this way, Answer Explorer's suggestions become more relevant for you as you continue to use the feature.

After you make a change to your Answer, you may want to go back to an earlier version of your Answer.
You can click the Back icon image:icon-arrow-left-10px.png[] to go back one step, or the Reset icon image:icon-reset-10px.png[] to go back to the original answer.

[#explore-filters]
== Filters

Use *Filters* to narrow down your search result to only include the data you want to see.
Answer Explorer uses sophisticated technology to show only the most relevant suggestions.
Click on a suggested filter to add it to your visualization.

NOTE: In Answer Explorer, you can only filter on *attribute* columns, not *measures*.

=== Add your own filters

If you want to filter on a column value that Answer Explorer did not suggest, you can add your own filter, using the *Filters* search bar.

. Click on the search bar under *Add your own*.

You would choose to filter on the *store region* column.

You can Drill down from within Answer Explorer.
When you Drill down in Answer Explorer, you have the option of going back one step at a time, using the Back icon image:icon-arrow-left-10px.png[].
You cannot go back one step at a time if you Drill down on an Answer in a Pinboard, without using Answer Explorer.

See xref:search-drill-down.adoc[Drill down].

== Save your new answer

When you find a valuable insight using Answer Explorer, you may want to save that Answer as it appears, instead of trying to recreate it in the *Search* bar.

. Click the *More* menu icon image:icon-more-10px.png[].
. Select *copy and edit*.
. *Save* your new Answer within ThoughtSpot and continue working with it.
. Alternatively, select *Download* to download an image of your current visualization.

You can also *pin* the current Answer to any Pinboard you have *edit* access to.
Click the *pin* icon image:icon-pin.png[] and select a Pinboard.

Otherwise, the Answer returns to its original state when you exit the *Explore* menu by clicking the _X_ icon.
