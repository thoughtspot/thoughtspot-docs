:description: Heatmap charts are similar to treemap charts.


Heatmap charts are similar to xref:chart-treemap.adoc[treemap charts]. They both use a similar system of color coding to represent data values.
However, the heatmap does not use size to measure data, and instead requires an additional attribute.

The value of each cell depends on the measure you choose under *Edit chart configuration*.

== Limitations
Heatmap charts do *_NOT_* support conditional formatting.
