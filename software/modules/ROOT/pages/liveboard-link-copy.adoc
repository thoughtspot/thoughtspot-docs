In Liveboards, there is a copy link option that lets you copy the link to access a specific visualization directly. This link opens the Liveboard in xref:answer-explorer.adoc[explore mode] for that visualization.

You can copy and paste the copied link to include in a presentation or spreadsheet, or email or Slack it to other people in your company.
Note that when clicking the link, the person must be authenticated to ThoughtSpot to see the visualization (for example,
by signing in, or through LDAP).

== Copy a visualization link

. Navigate to the Liveboard with the visualization you would like to copy a link for.
. Select the *More* menu icon image:icon-more-10px.png[more options menu icon] for the visualization.
. Select *Copy link*. The *Copy link* window appears.

. Select *Copy link* again.
The part of the link after `/pinboard/` is the visualization ID or GUID.
