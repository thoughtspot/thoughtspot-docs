:description: You can download the entire Liveboard in PDF format, so you can share it with people inside and outside your organization.


You can download a Liveboard in PDF format, so you can share it with people inside and outside your organization. You have options for adding branding, composing the report of the entire Liveboard or only some of its visualizations, truncating tables, and so on.

Follow these steps:

. Select *Liveboards* on the top navigation bar.
. Select a Liveboard from the list of Liveboards by clicking on its title.
. In the open Liveboard, click the *More* menu image:icon-more-10px.png[more options menu icon] (ellipses icon), and select *Download as PDF*.
. In the *Download* window modal, you have two main _Format_ output options:
 ** Select *<<pdf-liveboard,Liveboard>>* to generate a PDF that combines several visual answers on the same page, just like they appear on the Liveboard.
 ** Select  *<<pdf-visualizations,Visualizations>>* to print each visualization on its own page of the PDF file.

== Download PDF as Liveboard

The Liveboard mode produces a PDF file that looks very similar to the Liveboard inside ThoughtSpot.
The highlights appear at the top, and the rest of the Liveboard is on a rectangular grid, with natural page breaks.

Follow these steps to specify additional options:

. Under *Format*, select *Liveboard*.
. Under *Layout*, select either the _Landscape_ or _Portrait_ page orientation.
. If the Liveboard has multiple tabs, you see the *Select tabs to download* option. Select the specific tabs you would like to download, or select *All* to download all tabs. By default, ThoughtSpot includes all tabs in the PDF.

. Under *Branding*, specify if the PDF should include page numbers. If your cluster has a xref:customize-logo.adoc[custom logo], you may also see an option to include that logo in the footer.

. Under *Footer text*, you may be able to specify footer text to appear at the bottom of each page in the PDF. However, your admin may have set a xref:admin-portal-search-spotiq-settings.adoc#visualization-footer[standard footer] for all Answer and Liveboard downloads. If you have admin privileges, you can edit that footer for the whole cluster from the xref:admin-portal-search-spotiq-settings.adoc#visualization-footer[Admin Console]. If you do not have admin privileges, you cannot edit the standard footer for downloads.

. Select *Download*.

[#pdf-visualizations]
== Download PDF as Visualizations

When you select *Visualizations*, you can choose to print all, or some, of the visualizations in the Liveboard.
The highlights and insights appear at the top, and the rest of the visualizations get their own page.

Follow these steps to specify additional options:

. Under *Format*, select *Visualizations*.
. Under *Layout*, select either the _Landscape_ or _Portrait_ page orientation.
. Under *Content*, specify if you want the table visuals to end after filling the whole page by selecting the _Truncate Tables_ option.

. Under *Branding*, specify if the PDF should include page numbers. If your cluster has a xref:customize-logo.adoc[custom logo], you may also see an option to include that logo in the footer.

. Under *Footer text*, you may be able to specify footer text to appear at the bottom of each page in the PDF. However, your admin may have set a xref:admin-portal-search-spotiq-settings.adoc#visualization-footer[standard footer] for all Answer and Liveboard downloads. If you have admin privileges, you can edit that footer for the whole cluster from the xref:admin-portal-search-spotiq-settings.adoc#visualization-footer[Admin Console]. If you do not have admin privileges, you cannot edit the standard footer for downloads.

. Under *Visualizations*, select the visualizations you want in the PDF. Deselect any visualizations you do not want. If your Liveboard has tabs, you can also select or deselect tabs to include in the PDF.

. Select *Download*.

[#pdf-examine]
== Examine the PDF

After the download completes, examine your PDF.

Notice that the PDF produced in *Liveboard* mode combines the visuals on the page in the same manner as the original Liveboard.
Contrast this with the PDF produced in *Visualizations* mode: this PDF combines the small adjacent indicator and KPI visuals at the top, and all other visuals and tables appear on their own page.
