[#search]
== Search

*Search* is where you will spend most of your time.
It allows you to search and explore your data.
Choose your data sources and type in the search bar at the top.
As you type your search, results will appear in the main part of the screen as either a table or a chart.

[#answers]

Answers are the result of a single search.
You can save an answer you want to work more on later, or just keep it for your personal use.
Answers are for you alone, until you share them with others.

[#liveboards]
== Liveboards

Liveboards are collections of related search results.
You can create your own Liveboard or add to an existing one.
After saving a Liveboard, it can be shared with others or viewed as a slideshow.
The *Liveboards* page shows a list of saved Liveboards.
Select one to view, edit, or share it.
