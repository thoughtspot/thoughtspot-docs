SSO users do not see the option to change their password.

* The password must be 8 characters or more in length.
* The password must include at least 1 uppercase letter, 1 lowercase letter, 1 number, and 1 special character.

If the password is not complex enough, ThoughtSpot rejects it, even if it fulfills the other requirements.
