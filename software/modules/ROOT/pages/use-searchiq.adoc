. Type your search in the search bar using plain language.
+
If you see a microphone icon in the search bar, that means your operating system and browser are enabled for speech-to-text.
In this case, you can click the microphone and speak your search instead of typing.

. Press the *Enter* key when your search is complete.
. When your answer appears, you may also see one or more of these messages:
 ** Interpretation: You can see how different words you typed were understood.

 ** Ignored words: These words were not needed in order to create the answer, so they are ignored.

 ** Ambiguous words: These are words that could have more than one meaning in the context of the search.

You can clarify by choosing what you meant from the possible meanings shown.
