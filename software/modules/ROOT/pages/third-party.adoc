ThoughtSpot uses the following third-party software packages.

If you are running ThoughtSpot on RHEL, OEL, or Amazon Linux 2, ThoughtSpot uses additional third-party packages. Refer to xref:customer-os-packages.adoc[].

Click to download the full list of third-part packages in every software deployment in CSV format:

// note: publish library, version (not latest version), and licenses from the SCA report from Sara. delete log4j version 1.2.16 in new third-party lists (this may not be present in newer releases). remove the 4 cassandra/ apache cassandra packages and add one line: apache cassandra 4.0.7 apache20. add nginx for each release (ask Kirsten Stark for version). You also have to udpate the rhel/oel/al2 packages (customer-os-packages.adoc). Ask Kirsten Stark for those lists.
