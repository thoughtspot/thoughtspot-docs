You can have multiple measures on the y-axis of many charts.  You can manually set the y-axis range by clicking *edit* from the <<y-axis,y-axis label drop-down>>, or from the <<chart-config-edit,*chart configuration* menu>>.

[#y-axis]
== Setting the y-axis range from the axis label

. Under *Min* and *Max*, set the y-axis range by specifying start and end values.
+
In this example, the original chart shows *sales* values by *department*  from 0 to over $5M.
We can enter a y-axis range of `2500000` to `5000000` to  show only sales between $2.5M and $5M.
+
The chart reorganizes itself to reflect the new y-axis range.
+
To change the range for *gross profit margin*, click the dropdown menu icon next to the *gross profit margin* axis label.

== Create charts with multiple measures on the y-axis

You can have multiple measures on the y-axis of most (but not all) chart types.
You can configure this in the *chart configuration* panel, by dragging and dropping measures out of the *not visualized* section.
