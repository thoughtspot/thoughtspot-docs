Use the Data tab to manage data sources.

The *Data* tab lists all of the tables and data sources available to you.
There are three types of data sources that you may see in the data list.
They are tables, Worksheets, and user uploaded data.
You usually see only Worksheets and user-uploaded sources.
These are the most commonly used data sources for searching.

Clicking on the name of a table or data source shows you detailed information about it.
You won't be able to change these settings or edit the table unless it was shared with you with the *Edit* privilege.
To see how to edit a data source, refer to the _ThoughtSpot Administrator Guide_.

Use the filters at the top of the page to find the data you are interested in.
From the *Data* tab, you can also delete or apply stickers to tables and data sources in bulk by selecting them and clicking the appropriate action button.
