:description: Upgrade ThoughtSpot using ansible on RHEL clusters.

If your organization requires that privilege escalation take place through an external tool that integrates with ansible, follow the steps in this article to upgrade your cluster.

Before upgrading the cluster, ensure that the xref:rhel-install-ansible.adoc#system-settings[system settings] are correctly configured.

== Upgrading the cluster

. Rename *cluster_upgrade_hosts.sample* to *cluster_upgrade_hosts.yaml*.
. Update the ansible vars in *cluster_upgrade_hosts.yaml* with your own specific values. See <<ansible-vars,Sample ansible vars>>.
. Run the ansible-playbook. This upgrades the cluster. Run the following command on any cluster node:
+
[source,bash]
----
ansible-playbook -i cluster_upgrade_hosts.yaml cluster_upgrade.yaml
----
+
If privilege escalation requires a password, add the `-K` option to the `ansible-playbook` command.
. If there is a failure at any point, fix the failure and rerun the `ansible-playbook` command. Bypass the completed steps using the `--start-at-task` option, specifying the task at which to start.

[#ansible-vars]
=== Sample ansible vars

This is the definition of the *cluster_upgrade_hosts.sample* file that is present in your ansible tarball. You must replace anything in this file within `<>` with your own specific information.

[source,bash]
----
all:
  hosts:
    # List of IPs of the nodes in the cluster>
    <node_ip1>:
    <node_ip2>:
  vars:
    ssh_user: <ts_service_user>
    ansible_ssh_user: <ts_service_user>
    username: <ts_service_user>
    groupname: <ts_service_group>
    env: {}
    ssh_private_key: <Private key for ssh>
    tarball_location:<Release tarball complete path>  # Location of the tarball
    ramdisk_size: <size of ramdisk for falcon> # The default is 50619136k (50Gb)
    LOCAL: <Node IP from which upgrade is being run>  # Node on which upgrade ansible script is going to run.
    # Thoughtspot vars. Do not modify
    release_location: /export/release_cache
    hdfs_release_location: /hdfs/default/release/
    minimal_sudo_install: 1
    no_sudo: 1
