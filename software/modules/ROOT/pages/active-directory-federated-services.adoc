Learn how to configure ADFS to work with ThoughtSpot.

You can configure Active Directory Federated Services (ADFS) to work with ThoughtSpot.

== Prerequisites

Before you configure ADFS, complete these prerequisites.

. xref:saml.adoc[Configure SAML in ThoughtSpot].
. Install https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=10909[ADFS 2.0^].
ThoughtSpot supports ADFS 3.0, but recommends ADFS 2.0.
. Make sure you can run ADFS 2.0 Federation Server Configuration Wizard from the ADFS 2.0 Management Console.
. Make sure that the DNS name of your Windows Server is available at your service provider (SP) and vice versa.
You can do this by running the command `nslookup` in the command line on both machines, supplying the DNS of the other server.
The syntax is `nslookup [HOST] [SERVER]`.
Replace HOST and SERVER with your specific information.
+
[source,console]
----
 $ nslookup [HOST] [SERVER]
----

ADFS 2.0 supports SAML 2.0 in IDP (Identity Provider) mode and can be easily integrated with the SAML Extension for both SSO (Single Sign-On) and SLO (Single Log Out).

== Step 1: Initialize IDP metadata

. *Download the IDP metadata* Download the ADFS 2.0 IDP metadata from the ADFS server.
You can reference this file by its URL:
+
[source]
----
 https://<adfsserver>/FederationMetadata/2007-06/FederationMetadata.xml
----

. *SSH into your cluster* Log in to the Linux shell using SSH.
+
[source,console]
----
 $ ssh admin@<cluster-IP>
----

. *Change directories to the SAML directory*
+
[source,console]
----
 $ cd /usr/local/scaligent/release/production/orion/tomcat/callosum/saml
----

. *Update the metadata* Replace the contents of the file `idp-meta.xml` with the metadata of the IDP that you downloaded.
Do not change the name of the file.
. *Restart Tomcat* Contact {support-url}
 for help restarting ThoughtSpot's Tomcat instance.

== Step 2: Initialize the Service Provider metadata

=== 1: Import metadata

. Open the ADFS 2.0 Management Console.
. Select menu:Relying Party Trusts[Add Relying Party Trust].
. Select *Import data about the relying party from a file*.
. Upload the `metadata.xml` file that you downloaded from ThoughtSpot earlier.
. Select *Next*.
 ** There may be a warning that some of the content of the metadata is not supported.
You can safely ignore this warning.

=== 2: Edit claim rules

. In the *Ready to Add Trust* section, make sure that the tab endpoints contain multiple endpoint values.
 ** If not, verify that your metadata was generated with the HTTPS protocol URLs.
. Ensure that the *Open the Edit Claim Rules dialog* checkbox is checked.
. Click *Next*.
. Select *Add Rule*.
. Choose *Send LDAP Attributes as Claims*.
. Click *Next*.
. For *NameID* enter the name of your claim rule.
. For *Attribute store*, choose "Active Directory".
. For *LDAP Attribute*, choose "SAM-Account-Name".
. For *Outgoing claim type*, choose "Name ID".
 ** If you are using ADFS 3.0, you might need to configure the Name ID as a Pass Through claim.
. Finish the wizard.
. Confirm that all information is correct in the claim rules window.

=== 3. Specify your level of security

. Open the provider by double-clicking it.
. Select the *Advanced* tab.
. Under *Secure hash algorithm*, choose "SHA-256".
 ** If you have trouble with SHA-256, try SHA-1 instead.

You can now use ADFS.

== Step 3: Test your ADFS integration

After setting up the ADFS integration, make sure it works properly.
To test your ADFS integration, go to the ThoughtSpot login page using a Web browser and try to log in with SAML.
