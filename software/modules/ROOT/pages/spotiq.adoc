SpotIQ is a ThoughtSpot feature that helps you find insights into your data.
Insights are trends, correlations, and outliers (values significantly different from what is typical in your data).

Using SpotIQ, you can find interesting answers in your data that you might not have found on your own.
SpotIQ also learns from your responses to your insights.
Meaning, how you interact with SpotIQ results helps to build better results.

== Who can use SpotIQ?

The SpotIQ feature is made to be easily accessible for users who are not data magicians; you can get great results easily. However, power users can change SpotIQs parameters to fine tune their results. SpotIQ is for everyone.

If you can see the *SpotIQ* on your ThoughtSpot dashboard, you have access to SpotIQ.

If you can't see this option, ask your ThoughtSpot Administrator to give you the *Has SpotIQ* privilege.

== Where to find SpotIQ actions
