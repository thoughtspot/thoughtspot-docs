:description: You can upgrade your Python version to Python 3.9 or remain on the default version.

By default, your ThoughtSpot cluster comes with either Python 3.6 or Python 3.7. You can upgrade your Python version to Python 3.9 or remain on the default version.

[NOTE]
====
*_ThoughtSpot-managed CentOS deployments only:_* If you upgraded to Python 3.9 while on ThoughtSpot version 7.2.1, you must upgrade your Python version to 3.9 again after you upgrade to ThoughtSpot version 8.4.0.sw.

This does not apply to customer-managed Amazon Linux 2 or RHEL deployments. Amazon Linux 2 or RHEL deployments do not need to upgrade their Python version again.

== Supported Python versions
ThoughtSpot supports use of the following versions of Python 3 for deployment. Python 3.6 is the current default version for customer-managed RHEL, customer-managed OEL, and ThoughtSpot-managed CentOS. Python 3.7 is the current default version for customer-managed Amazon Linux 2.

* Python 3.6: ThoughtSpot-managed CentOS for AWS, GCP, VMware, Azure, SMC, and Dell; customer-managed xref:rhel.adoc[RedHat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)]; customer-managed xref:rhel.adoc[Oracle Enterprise Linux (OEL)]; customer-managed xref:al2.adoc[Amazon Linux 2]
* Python 3.7: customer-managed Amazon Linux 2
* Python 3.9: ThoughtSpot-managed CentOS for AWS, GCP, and Azure; customer-managed xref:rhel.adoc[RedHat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)]; customer-managed xref:al2.adoc[Amazon Linux 2]

== Upgrade your Python version
After you create the cluster, upgrade your Python version to Python 3.9.

To upgrade your Python version, follow these steps:

. `ssh` into a node as an admin user.
+
----
ssh admin@<node-IP>
----

. Run the following command to stop your cluster:
+
----
tscli cluster stop
----

. Ensure that the version of Python you want to use is <<supported-versions,ThoughtSpot-certified>> for your deployment type. Python 3.9 is not certified for customer-managed OEL or ThoughtSpot-managed CentOS for VMware, SMC, or Dell.
. Install Python version 3.9.
. Navigate to the correct location to run the command:
+
----
cd /usr/local/scaligent/release/
----
. Run the following command on all nodes, at `/usr/local/scaligent/release/` for each node:
+
----
PATH=/usr/pgsql-11/bin:$PATH pip3 install -r production/prod_image/current/pip_packages/requirements_no_versions.txt --upgrade
----
. Run the following command to start your cluster again:
+
----
tscli cluster start
----
