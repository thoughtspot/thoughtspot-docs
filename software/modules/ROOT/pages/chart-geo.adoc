:description: Geo charts show data on a map by location. ThoughtSpot has three types of geo charts: geo area, geo bubble, and geo heatmap charts.

Geo charts show data on a map by location. There are three geo charts that let you visualize geographical data in ThoughtSpot: xref:chart-geo-area.adoc[geo area], xref:chart-geo-bubble.adoc[geo bubble], and xref:chart-geo-heatmap.adoc[geo heatmap] charts.
And these geo charts can display six types of geographical data, depending on territory:

* Country
* State
* County
* Zip code
* Point (latitude/longitude)
* Other sub-nation regions (for international countries)

ThoughtSpot supports maps for many countries. See the complete list in xref:geomap-reference.adoc[Geo Map Reference]. If you would like to use a custom map to visualize your data, see xref:geomaps-custom.adoc[].
