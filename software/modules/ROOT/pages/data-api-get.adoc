This procedure shows how to use the REST API to get data out of ThoughtSpot, so you can use it in a webpage, portal, or application.

Data retrieved using the Data REST API is returned as JSON (JavaScript Object Notation).

Before you can use the Data REST API, you need to enable the xref:js-api-enable.adoc[JavaScript API (JS API)] and authenticate to ThoughtSpot.

Use this procedure to construct the URL you will use to call the Data REST API:

. Sign in to ThoughtSpot from a browser.
. Navigate to the Liveboard from which you want to get data.
If it doesn't exist yet, create it now.
. Find the ID number of the object you want to get the data from. Select the *More* menu icon image:icon-more-10px.png[more options menu icon] for the object and select *Copy embed link*.
. Copy the ID number from the link shown.
Paste it somewhere so that you can use it later to construct the URL to use when calling the REST API.
+
If the object is:
+
Liveboard:: Copy the identifier that appears after "viz/".
Omit the trailing "/".
+
image::copy_link_pinboard.png[The copy link modal, with the Liveboard ID after viz/ highlighted]
Visualization:: Copy the entire identifier that appears after "viz/". This is the visualization ID. This includes the Liveboard ID as well.
+
*Note:* A visualization is a table or a chart.
+
image::copy_link_viz_pinboard_part.png[The copy link modal, with the visualization ID after viz/ highlighted]

. Construct the URL as follows: For a Liveboard, the URL takes the form:
+
[source,html]
----
https://<thoughtspot_server>/callosum/v1/tspublic/v1
  /pinboarddata?id=<pinboard_id>
----
+
For a visualization, the URL takes the form:
+
[source,html]
----
 https://<thoughtspot_server>/callosum/v1/tspublic/v1
  /pinboarddata?id=<pinboard_id>&vizid=%5B<visualization_id>%5D
----

. If you want to apply any filters to the data that will be returned, apply xref:runtime-filters.adoc[Runtime Filters].
. Now your URL is complete, and you can use it to access the data directly through the HTTP POST method.
The Data REST API returns the data formatted as JSON.
. Retrieve the data from the JSON and display it in your webpage, web portal, or application.
