= Reaggregation Scenario 2: Average rates of exchange

The Average rate of exchange calculates for the selected period.
These average rates provide a mechanism to hedge the value of loans against price fluctuations in the selected period.
We apply the average rate _after the aggregation_.

The pseudo-logic that governs the value of loans is `sum(loans) * average(rate)`.

The data model has two tables: a primary fact table, and a dimension table for `rates`.

* The `loans` column is from the primary fact table.
* The `rate` column is from the `rates` table.

These tables are at different levels of aggregation:

* The primary fact table uses a lower level of aggregation, on `product`, `department`, or `customer`.
* The `rates` dimension table use a higher level of aggregation, on `daily`, `transaction currency`, or `reporting currency`.

The two tables are joined through a relationship join on `date` and `transaction currency`.

To simplify the scenario, we only use a single `reporting currency`.
The join ensures that a single rate value returns each day for each transaction currency.

----
sum(group_aggregate (sum(loans)*average (rate),
                     query_groups () + {transaction_currency},
                     query_filters () ))
----

The following search and resulting response returns the dollar value for each year, for each target reporting currency.
Note that the dataset contains both euro (&#8364;) and US dollars (&#36;).
The `$ Loans Avg.
Rate`  calculates the average rate of exchange for the entire period.
The `$ Loans Spot Rate` applies the rate of exchange on the day of the transaction.

== Resolution

. The `sum(loans)` function aggregates to these attributes:
 ** `+{transaction_currency}+` and `query_groups()`
+
Add additional search columns to this aggregation.
Here, this at the level of `reporting currency` and `year`.

 ** `query_filters( )`
+
Applies any filters entered in the search.
Here, there are no filters.
. Similarly, the `average(rate)` function aggregates to these attributes:
 ** `+{transaction_currency}+` and `query_groups()`
+
Add additional search columns to this aggregation.
Here, this at the level of `reporting currency` and `year`.

 ** `query_filters( )`
+
Applies any filters entered in the search.
Here, there are no filters.
. For each row in this virtual table, the exchange rate applies to the sum of loans: `sum(loans) * average(rate)`.
. The outer `sum()` function reaggregates the final output as a single row for each yearly reporting currency value.
+
NOTE: The default aggregation setting does not reaggregate the result set.

== Non-Aggregated Result

include::partial$intro-non-aggregated.adoc[]

In the following scenario, the formula assumes that the default aggregation applies.
Here, the result returns 1 row for each `transaction currency`.

----
group_aggregate (sum(loans )*average (rate ),
                 query_groups() + {transaction_currency},
                 query_filters())
----
