[#overview]
== Overview

A field is a column in a database table.
A calculated field is a field that uses existing database fields and applies additional logic -- it allows you to create new data from your existing data.

A calculated field either:

* performs some calculation on database fields to create a value that is not directly stored in the database, or
* selects values in database fields based on some customized criteria.

*When to use calculated fields*

Calculated fields lend to more flexibility and efficiency in your analyses.

* Power multiple visual analyses with one query - You can now create multiple calculations on top of one Helix-powered query.
Whether you're exploring your data or answering follow-up questions from your stakeholders, you'll no longer have to revisit your multiple SQL queries multiple times.
* Take full advantage of filtering and drill down features - Previously, some aggregations of pre-aggregated SQL fields led to incorrect results.
* Empower non-SQL stakeholders - People who aren't familiar with SQL but perhaps are familiar with similar tools like Tableau can now answer their own questions.

Some common scenarios for when you'd want to use calculated fields include:

* The metrics you need for your analysis are not directly stored in your data warehouse.
* You want to transform values for your visualization.
* You want to quickly aggregate or filter your data.

== Creating a calculated field

. Click the app switcher icon in the top navigation bar and select *{product}*, then sign in to your Workspace.
. Click the green `+` to create a new report in the upper right-hand corner.
. Run a SQL query.
(It can be as simple as `SELECT * FROM table`.)
. Create a new chart.
. Click the *New field* button to open the calculated field formula editor:
+

. From the chart builder, click the *New field* icon to open the calculated field formula editor:
+
[.bordered]
image::create_cal_field_chart_builder.png[Create calculated field in chart builder]

. Type in a name and formula for your calculated field.
This example uses the formula:   `SUM(CASE [Status] WHEN 'CANCELLED' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)/SUM(1)`.
+
This formula checks for whether the order status was cancelled.
It will sum up the tally of cancelled orders and divide by the total number of rows to calculate the cancellation rate.
+
TIP: To see the full list of functions {product} currently supports, open the panel on the right-hand side.
+

. When you're done, hit *Apply* or *Done*.

You have now created your first calculated field.
You should see it in your fields list, with an equal sign (=) next to the data type icon to indicate that it is a calculated field.

=== Using a calculated field

*In charts*

You can chart your calculated field just as you could a SQL-generated field, by selecting and dragging the field into your chart menu.

*In filters*

You can also filter your calculated field just as you could a SQL-generated field.

=== Calculated field best practices

*Calculation building blocks*

These are the four basic components that make up any calculated field:

* *Fields* - columns from your data source, can be either a dimension or a measure.
* *Operators* - symbols that denote a certain operation, like `+` and `-` .
* *Functions* - transform the given input to an expected output, like `COUNT()` and `SUM()`.
* *Literal expressions* - constant values that are represented as is.
This includes numbers (`1`), strings (`"This is a string"`), dates (`\#2020-06-01#`), booleans (`true`), and `null`.

Additionally, calculated fields can also contain:

* *Parameters* - fixed values that functions expect as input, such as `'week'` in `DATEPART()`.
* *Comments* - notes or commentary about the calculation that will not be included in the computation.
Comments in calculated fields are always marked by a prepended `//`.

==== Field properties

|===
| Property | Description | In {product}

| *Dimension*

💡 *For calculated field window functions, it will be helpful to understand how window partitions are defined.*

SQL allows you to perform aggregations in different levels of the view using window functions, generally written as `OVER (PARTITION BY column)`.
Window functions also exist in calculated fields, though the way you define window partitions is different.

* Instead of specifying the partition directly in the formula code, you'd drag and drop the field into your chart axis along with your window calculated field.
The system will automatically re-calculate the values depending on your dimension.
* For moving windows, you'd specify a `<start>` and `<end>` relative to the current row.
 ** In general, `-n` refers to the nth row before the current row, and `n` refers to the nth row after the current row.
 ** You can also crate offsets based on the first or last rows in the expression, using `FIRST()+n` and `LAST()-n`.
  *** `FIRST()` always returns `-1` for the second row, `-2` for the third row, etc.
  *** `LAST()` always returns `1` for the second-to-last row, `2` for the third-to-last row, etc.

*_The corresponding formula for this window sum would be `WINDOW_SUM(SUM([field]), -3, 2)`._*

=== Calculated field component types

Unlike your SQL results, which are always constants, calculated fields have different computation levels:

|===
| Order | Type | Description | Examples

| 1
| Constant
| A fixed value.
| `1` +
`TRUE`

| 2
| Scalar
| Values are mapped to a single result in a one-to-one manner.
| `ABS()` +
`DATEDIFF()`

| 3
| Aggregate
| Values of multiple rows are grouped together as the input to form a single value of more significant meaning.
| `COUNT()` +
`SUM()`

| 4
| Analytical
| Computes aggregate values over a group of rows.
| `LOOKUP()` +
`RUNNING_SUM()`
|===

[discrete]
====== Component operations

You can combine various component types in *operation*.

*Example:*

* `1 + [column]` will add 1 to every row in your column.
The result of that operation will take the greatest order of the combined data types -- `constant + scalar` returns a `scalar` result.
* `1 + SUM([column])`

However, there are limitations to what calculated fields you can use in *functions*.

*Non-examples:*

* Aggregating an aggregate - `SUM(COUNT([column]))` ❌
* Mixing aggregate and non-aggregate values in certain functions - `DATEDIFF('day', created_at, MAX(updated_at))` ❌
* Using scalar values in an analytical function - `RUNNING_COUNT([id])` ❌

=== FAQs

[discrete]
==== *Q: How do you get the running percentage total of a field?*

We do have some ways of utilizing analytic functions within our calculated fields to calculate percent over total.
Check out this link:https://mode.com/blog/analytic-functions-in-calculated-fields/[blog on Analytic Functions,window=_blank] and how to use them in {product}.

[discrete]
==== *Q: How to do a CASE statement where the condition is a comparison (e.g. \<=)?*

You use `CASE` statements for _direct equality_ against *one* field.
For example:

[source,sql]
----
CASE [status]
WHEN 'Completed' THEN 1
WHEN 'Cancelled' THEN 0
ELSE NULL END
----

If you wish to compare *multiple* fields or use comparisons, then you'd use an `IF` statement.
For example:

[source,sql]
----
IF [revenue] > 0 OR [cost] < 0 THEN 'Profitable'
ELSEIF [revenue] = 0 OR [cost] = 0 THEN 'Neutral'
ELSE 'Unprofitable'
END
----

[discrete]
==== *Q: Are special characters allowed in the calculated field name?*

We currently do not allow brackets like `[` and `]` in the calculated field name.
This is for parsing and usability reasons, because you can reference calculated fields by their names in other calculated field formulas.

[#troubleshooting]
==== Troubleshooting

[discrete]
===== *1. Why am I getting a 'Cannot combine aggregate and non-aggregate fields' error?*

You cannot _directly_ combine and/or compare aggregate and non-aggregate fields because they are different <<calculated-field-component-types,component types>>.

* Let's say your non-aggregate field contains the data `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
It has a cardinality of `5`.
* An aggregate calculated field, such as `SUM([field])` yields the result `15`.
It has a cardinality of `1`.

[discrete]
===== *2. My calculated field is not saving.*

A calculated field will not be saved if it exceeds the maximum number of characters (1024).
Please ensure that your calculated field does not exceed this limit in order to save it successfully.

If the issue is not the above, please don't hesitate to reach out to {support-url} for further assistance.
