== Deployment options

There are two options for your users to download ThoughtSpot Mobile:

* App Store for iOS or Google Play for Android
* Your MDM platform

=== App Store for iOS or Google Play for Android

The ThoughtSpot app is available from the App Store and Google Play.
Your users can download it directly from there.

=== Mobile device or app management platform

There are two ways to provide the ThoughtSpot app to your users with your MDM platform:

==== Option 1 [Recommended]: Provide a link to the App Store or Google Play.

Almost all of the platforms allow you to link to the ThoughtSpot app in either app store.
With this option, your users download it directly and automatically receive the latest updates, when they are available.

To add a link to the ThoughtSpot app on your management platform, refer to the following platform-specific information:
