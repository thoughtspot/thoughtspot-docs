:description: ThoughtSpot Mobile Answers.

ThoughtSpot Search results generate tables and charts. When you save them for future use, we call these saved searches Answers.

You can view Answers created in the ThoughtSpot web app in ThoughtSpot Mobile. For more information about creating an Answer in the ThoughtSpot web app, see link:https://docs.thoughtspot.com/cloud/latest/automated-answer-creation[Automated Answer Creation].

NOTE: ThoughtSpot Mobile users can view but not edit Answers in ThoughtSpot Mobile.

Answers are sorted by into the following three categories in ThoughtSpot Mobile:

* *Favorites* - Lists all of the Answers that you have marked as your personal favorites.
* *All* - Lists all Answers that you have view access to.
* *Yours* - Lists all Answers that you created.

At the end of the first paragraph (before the note), I suggest you describe briefly what you can do with Answers in ThoughtSpot mobile. If it is only to search Answers, you can say that and then have it link to the Search Answers article.
If users cannot create answers in ThoughtSpot Mobile, we should indicate that and provide a link to an article on how to create an Answer in the ThoughtSpot web app.
