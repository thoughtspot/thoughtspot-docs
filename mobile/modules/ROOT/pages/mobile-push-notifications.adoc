[#mobile-push-notifications,Push Notifications]

You can now receive push notifications from ThoughtSpot Mobile, when a Liveboard or Answer is shared with you. You can also monitor scheduled and threshold alerts using push notifications.

For more information about enabling or disabling notifications in the ThoughtSpot web app, see link:https://docs.thoughtspot.com/cloud/latest/web-notifications[Notifications].

NOTE: You will also need to enable notifications for the ThoughtSpot Mobile app on your mobile device to ensure that you receive push notifications.

if there is any steps they need to do to set that up that you can point them to (even in the TSA docs) that would be helpful.

Also, any screenshot that could illustrate any of this would be a nice addition.
