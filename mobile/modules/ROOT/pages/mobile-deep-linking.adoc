[#deep-linking]

You can share a link to objects in ThoughtSpot using instant messaging or email and the recipient can open the link in the ThoughtSpot Mobile app or the ThoughtSpot web app. If a user has ThoughtSpot Mobile, the link opens directly in ThoughtSpot Mobile. If they donâ€™t have ThoughtSpot Mobile, they are presented with the option to download it or to view it in the ThoughtSpot web app.
