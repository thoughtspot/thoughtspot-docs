ThoughtSpot Mobile users who belong to multiple Orgs, will see data from the Org that they currently have selected in the ThoughtSpot web app by default. If you have access to multiple Orgs, when you log in to ThoughtSpot Mobile for the first time the first Org from the list of Orgs is selected. If you have previously logged in to ThoughtSpot Mobile, the Org from the last session that you logged-out of is selected.

Users with access to multiple Orgs can switch between them in ThoughtSpot Mobile.
